 (Caller Instructions)
 Thank you. Tom?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you, Katharine. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you saw, we had a challenging third quarter, due primarily to slightly negative used unit comps.
 Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. Used unit comps decreased by 0.8%, while total used units grew by 3.2%. Gross profit per used unit of $2,160 was in line with gross profit per unit of $2,172 in the third quarter of last year, and total wholesale units grew 3.4%, about the same rate as total retail units. Gross profit for wholesale unit grew by $22 to $949 per car sold. CAF income also grew 3% to approximately $92 million. I'll turn it over to Tom Reedy to talk about finance. Tom?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Reedy,  CarMax Inc - EVP and CFO   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. As Tom mentioned, CAF income grew by 3% compared to third quarter FY15 and average managed receivables grew by 15%, to $9.3 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to customers was 7.3%, up somewhat from last year's third quarter of 7%. Our total interest margin declined to 6% of average managed receivables from 6.4% in the third quarter of last year and 6.2% last quarter.
 We saw some tick-up in charge-offs during the quarter, which resulted in a modest increase in loss provision. However, at $91 million, our ending allowance for loan losses was 0.97% of managed receivables, consistent with last year's third quarter at 0.98%. CAF net penetration was 42.9% compared with 41.8% in last year's third quarter; the increase reflects a mix shift towards higher credit applications in the stores.
 The percent of CAF penetration attributable to our sub-prime test was unchanged at about 0.5%. Net loan dollars originated in the quarter rose 6% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, due to a combination of CarMax unit sales growth and a higher penetration. As you saw in the press release, Tier 3 financing as a percent of sales was 150 basis points lower than in the third quarter of FY15.
 This decrease was primarily due to the mix shift I mentioned with regard to CAF penetration. In Q3, we experienced a year-over-year decline in the number of credit applications across the lower end of credit, but moderate growth at the higher end. During the third quarter, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for about $446 million.
 We ended the quarter at the low end of our target range for leverage, which is book debt-to-capital after backing out the notes and receivables associated with non-recourse securitizations of 35% to 45%. Going forward, we expect to continue using share repurchase as a means of managing capital structure and returning value to shareholders. Tom?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you. As a percentage of our sales mix this quarter, zero- to four-year-old cars increased to approximately 81% compared to 75% in the third quarter of last year and 79% in the second quarter. SUVs and trucks as a percentage of sales were 23%, down from 25% in last year's third quarter, but up slightly from 22% in the second quarter. Our lower used unit comps were primarily a result of modestly lower traffic in our stores, partially offset by better conversion.
 Total web traffic increased by 7% compared to the same period last year. We believe our comps may have been impacted by several factors of note this quarter. First, we've seen a decrease in the supply of 5 to 10-year-old cars, as you would expect. Second, we've seen very aggressive promotions and lease offerings from new vehicles that appear to be pressuring sales of zero- and 1-year-old cars.
 Full sale prices of trucks and SUVs have increased, so some don't represent a good value for our customers. As Tom mentioned, Tier 3 was down about 150 basis points due to lower credit applications. Despite these factors, we still sold over 154,000 cars during the quarter, which is the most ever in a third quarter for the Company and our average store during the quarter sold 340 cars.
 SG&amp;A for the third quarter increased about 7% to $338 million. Contributing to this growth was the 10% increase in our store base since the beginning of the third quarter of last year, partially offset by a decrease of $6.5 million in share-based compensation expense. In addition, our advertising expense grew by about $9 million year-over-year, reflecting the timing of expenses related to our new ad campaign.
 During the third quarter, we opened two stores in existing markets: our sixth store in Houston, and our second store in Minneapolis. We also relocated our Rockville, Maryland store to its new larger location in Gaithersburg, and after the end of the quarter, we entered the Boston market with the opening of two stores in Danvers and Norwood. With that, operator, we will open it up for questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (Operator Instructions)
 Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Fassler,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks a lot, and good morning. My first question relates to SUVs. I knew you guys were down about 200 basis points year-on-year. Do you have a sense for what the used market is doing for SUV mix in general? In other words, do you think used market sales of SUVs -- do you think the mix of SUVs for the market is down? Is it flat? Is it up? Are you differing in the way you're indexing in SUVs versus your broader competition?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'm not sure versus the broader competition, Matt, but we were up a point compared to the second quarter. We still sold a lot of trucks and SUVs in the quarter, 23% of our total sales, but as I mentioned, prices were pretty high during the quarter and, as you know, we buy a lot of cars at the auction and our buyers are trying to make sure we always deliver a great value to our customers.
 So there are times during the quarter when we just didn't think it was worth overpaying at the expense of giving a great value to the consumer, but I think this is probably short-lived. Obviously, it's been driven by low gas prices. We've seen bigger increases in new car sales as it relates to SUVs and trucks compared to the used car market increases, but ultimately these cars will all come back into the market at some point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Fassler,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And then my follow-up, very briefly, the advertising dollar shift into Q3, was that out of Q2 or out of Q4?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Really, we just wanted to point out that we launched a new campaign during the quarter and that this just -- it wouldn't be a typical increase for us in terms of our quarter-over-quarter expense, given the sales level that we had. So we weren't really trying to say it came from one place or the other, just this is not what you would expect typically from us on a year-over-year basis. We did create and launch a new campaign during the quarter that started in September.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Fassler,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And how do you guys feel that campaign went as you measure. Given where the sales were, as you measure the return on that ad campaign -- I know it's a bit early to judge -- but your own evaluation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, it's very early to judge, particularly when you have a new broadcast campaign. It's mostly around brand building and not necessarily for short-term sales gain. You guys know we're not promotional. We don't have sales so most of our campaigns are long-term brand building.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Fassler,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you, Matt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brian Nagel,  Oppenheimer &amp; Company - Analyst   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. First, my first question is just basically a follow-up to what Matt asked, but Tom, thanks for laying out some of the extra color there with regard to sales in the quarter. But how do we think about, if we take those individually, how do we think about the trajectory from here? It seems [as the] comments you made that some of those factors will begin to abate here, but maybe a little more color on that as to how we should think about these factors going into the balance of this fiscal year and into 2016?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It's very difficult to attribute a number of points to each of the factors. They are just all things that we noted during the quarter. We also had our toughest comparison of the year, which I didn't mention, and our two-year stack comp in the third quarter was actually higher than it was in the second quarter. But each of these things had a little bit of an impact on our ability to deliver during the quarter. Most of them, I think, are short-lived.
 It's very difficult to predict trends and when things are going to change and supply, but we've done a really nice job over the last several years of being able to adjust and adapt to changing trends in the used car marketplace. We'll do the same here. I just thought those were things we should have pointed out during the quarter. A lot of the supply stuff is going to take care of itself over time and we're going to take advantage of the things that present themselves to us.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brian Nagel,  Oppenheimer &amp; Company - Analyst   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it. So maybe a follow-up to that. There's a lot of commentary out there about new competitors coming into your marketplace. Have you seen anything new with respect to your stores that may compete more directly with some of this new competition?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It's an ever-changing marketplace. A lot of the stuff we've seen is around digital capabilities, which we're working really hard to continue to increase for our customers. As I mentioned, remember, our average store sold 340 cars a month during the quarter. If you look at industry data, the average new car dealer sells about 50 cars a month.
 So it's really hard to say that we're losing ground and a lot of the stuff that you read about from new competition are very small players in very limited markets. So it's not likely that we're seeing an impact across the nation for our 153 stores when a lot of the press you see is around very small players in limited markets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brian Nagel,  Oppenheimer &amp; Company - Analyst   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it. Thanks, and best of luck for the balance of the year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Brian Nagel (laughter).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sharon Zackfia,  William Blair &amp; Company - Analyst   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hi, good morning. My first question is pretty easy. I did not see any quantification of the ad spend, the launch and how much of that might have been incremental. Tom, do you have any color you could provide on that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We did not quantify it, but of the $9 million difference year-over-year, the majority of it was around the new launch.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sharon Zackfia,  William Blair &amp; Company - Analyst   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, and then obviously, you have seen many cycles in terms of how the wholesale market adjusts to maybe supply/demand anomalies. On this whole conversation around SUVs, could you provide some historical perspective perhaps about anomalies you might have seen in the past and how long a correction might take in the pricing in the wholesale market?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I could probably comment on some anomalies in the past, but in terms of how long a correction takes, there's too many macro factors involved. But we're seeing, as you -- the highest SAR we've ever seen and the bigger of the increase in the SAR is related to trucks and SUVs. If I was thinking about that over a long period of time, that means a couple years from now we'll see lots of trucks and SUVs out in the wholesale market, which, if there's demand, then we'll be able to take advantage of that and buy and sell them.
 The other big variable that's impossible to predict is, first, gas prices and then, second, the impact of gas prices. I know you remember back in the spring of 2008 when gas hit $4, nobody would buy an SUV of any kind, but in October of that same year, gas was below $2 and things went back to where they were.
 Since then, when we've seen gas prices increase, we haven't seen the same knee-jerk reaction that we saw. So gas prices have been pretty low for a while and it has provided a boost for trucks and SUVs, but it's really hard to say what will happen going forward. I just think our model is best equipped to take advantage of whatever the market brings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sharon Zackfia,  William Blair &amp; Company - Analyst   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And I know I'm violating--
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We're not beholden to any manufacturer or any type of product and we want to sell whatever the customer wants to buy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sharon Zackfia,  William Blair &amp; Company - Analyst   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I want to violate Katharine's two-question rule. Just one last follow-up. Is what you're seeing right now, would you characterize as the normal ebbs and flows that you've seen in the market over time, or is there anything that gives you longer-term, more fundamental concerns?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We don't see anything that causes us long-term concerns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sharon Zackfia,  William Blair &amp; Company - Analyst   [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, great. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you, Sharon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Craig Kennison,  Robert W. Baird &amp; Company, Inc. - Analyst   [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, as well. I know it's early, but you did just enter the Boston market and I'm curious if you've seen any or had any surprises as you entered that market?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We've been open for less than a week (laughter), so I really couldn't -- I'm not going to comment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Craig Kennison,  Robert W. Baird &amp; Company, Inc. - Analyst   [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Even from a staffing standpoint? You're able to staff the different types of positions you need?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We were able to staff. I will say Boston was a bit challenging with staffing, but our teams did a great job of finding a bunch of really great people and we're very excited about our go-forward there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Craig Kennison,  Robert W. Baird &amp; Company, Inc. - Analyst   [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And then in terms of technology, could you cover, Tom, your priorities for the next 12 months in terms of digital and technology initiatives?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Our priorities are somewhat unchanged. We want to keep making sure that our customers have a great experience regardless of how they interact with CarMax. It could be from a desktop, it could be from a mobile device, a tablet, or in the store. We are very focused on making the transition from their digital experience to the store simple and seamless so that they -- the experience they have online matches up with the experience that they have in the store.
 We are also pushing real hard over the next 12 months or so to make sure that our store teams are equipped with information that's available regarding the individual customers to try to make their experience more personalized. We have a very big database of customers and we're working to make sure that we can access that information and that our associates in the store can access the information when the customers arrive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Craig Kennison,  Robert W. Baird &amp; Company, Inc. - Analyst   [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Great. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And also, we want to just keep increasing capabilities of customers if they want to do more and more of the transaction online.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Craig Kennison,  Robert W. Baird &amp; Company, Inc. - Analyst   [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning, guys. Just a first question. Tom, as we think about these tougher comps, basically we're looking at multi-decade lows in the zero- to five-year-old portion of the fleet in absolute terms, and certainly 30-plus-year lows as far as the percentage of the total population of cars outstanding. As we see that zero- to five-year-old bucket grow in the next one, two, or three years, don't you just naturally -- wouldn't you just naturally expect your same-store sales to recover as that addressable market recovers and the pressure we're seeing here is just a function of the supply?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I expect us to be able to comp our stores over a long period of time and there's lots of external factors that either help or hurt. I've always felt like the supply of zero- to five-year-old cars increasing is good for us. It's an area where, on a market share basis, if you look at an individual year-to-year basis, we have -- it's been our sweet spot, so I agree. As the supply increases there, I think we'll do better in those segments.
 What I feel even -- what I also feel good about is, coming out of the recession, we did a really good job of figuring out how to sell older cars, as well and I feel like we can do both. So you look at the CarMax consumer offer in its zero- to 10-year-old cars and we're pretty good across the spectrum at near-new cars and then older cars with higher miles. I don't think anybody does as good a job reconditioning as we do. I don't think anybody's in a better position to take advantage of those sales as we are.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, and then just a follow-up on the second question. When you look at the gap of new versus used pricing and then you look at the financing offerings that are at --in the new vehicle dealers for new vehicles, it just seems like it's very compelling for a zero to five or even a zero to ten consumer to trip into buying a new vehicle. If you look at a zero- to five-year-old car, basically the gap on a monthly payment base is $150 or actually potentially significantly less depending on what kind of financing they get at the new vehicle dealership.
 How do you fight that tide? Do you think you just need that supply plus pricing to come down to create a wider gap to drive those consumers back into used vehicles? Because it's incredibly tight right now. I'm just trying to understand how that dynamic might change and if there's anything you can do to help change it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, it's not like this hasn't happened before. There are always pockets or segments of near-new cars that, given incentive environment, whether it's through cash back or leasing, often times consumers will make that decision. It doesn't mean they won't come back to us three or four or five years later when they are buying something different.
 I do want to point out our average car is around $20,000 and the average new car is around $33,000, so the difference on average has not come down at all. In fact, it's widened. But it's always true that at any given point in time, given -- depending on the incentive environment, that there are some close calls there. It was especially true this quarter. That's why I pointed it out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Great. Thank you very much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All right. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine of Stifel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James Albertine,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst   [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just another follow-up on the trends you're seeing in the new cycle. Quite frankly, you've lived through a lot of obstacles and a lot of other headwinds over the last 20 years. Doesn't seem like there's anything you can't weather, but it seems like this time might be a little different, particularly among the domestic manufacturers, given the propensity to lease.
 Is there a higher likelihood that some of these new vehicles that are selling on the SUV and truck side go back to dealers rather than hitting the auction market and could that limit your availability of supply in the coming years? Or is that something that you have considered and aren't really worried about?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, it's something we've lived through before in terms of percent of new car sales that are leased. The number now is around 30%. It's been this high at times before.
 Generally, what that means is two, three years down the road, those cars will come back to the market in a more organized way and dealers won't be able to absorb the volume that comes back and a lot of those cars end up at auction. That's what's happened historically and we've been able to take advantage of that in the past.
 I never look at a high lease environment as a negative for us when you think about supply two or three years later. If you think about the cycle of people getting out of a new car, if it remains that people get out of their car every three to five years, it really doesn't make any difference whether it comes back through a lease channel or it comes back as an individual car. Eventually, they end up in the open marketplace and we have an opportunity to buy them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James Albertine,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst   [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it. That ties with your 340 cars per month comment versus 50 per month average that you made earlier. There's not a capacity for the dealers to handle the off-lease so I appreciate that color.
 Then a quick follow-up on the credit market, now that we've finally seen a rate increase. If you look over the last few CAF securitizations, it appears as though the spread might be stabilizing.
 But really wanted to get an update there as to what you think. If we are near that stabilization point or even now that rates are up optically, consumers are expecting higher rates, does that allow you now to increase the APR and maybe even see that spread expand in the near term? Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Reedy,  CarMax Inc - EVP and CFO   [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, this is Tom. As far as the spread to the customer goes, that's really going to be market-dependent, as we've said in the past. Our first goal of CarMax auto finance is to provide a competitive offer to the customer and we will go where the market dictates we go. That said, we're constantly testing both up and down to make sure we're optimizing CarMax sales and CAF income at the same time.
 We have seen a little bit of cost of funds increase this year. We have been testing rates upward a little bit, but I really can't give you any forward-looking theory on where that spread will go because it's going to be market-rate based. Historically, as rates have come up, we've been a little bit, as the market has, slower to adjust upward because rates tend to be sticky. Conversely, when rates have been coming down, you're usually a little slow to adjust downward because the market is going to drive that as well and you see a little bit of a benefit.
 But as far as going forward, the market will tell. Now that the fed has given some guidance about where they are going with interest rates, that stabilized things from the perspective of spreads in the asset-backed market. We saw our spreads gap up in the last deal versus prior deals even though we're in a lower interest rate environment, but some of that was uncertainty around what the fed was going to do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Lyn Walther,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst   [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just regarding traffic, can you talk about, was that consistent throughout the quarter? Any regions that you saw more impact than others?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We don't give regional or quarterly differences. I said what it was for the quarter and that's all the information we give.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Lyn Walther,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst   [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Let me just ask one other one then, if that's okay. Just following up on your digital capabilities that you're talking about adding, how should we think about the kind of investments required to bring those up to what you're talking about?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, a lot of the investment can be done within our normal spend over the course of a year. We have a pretty significant spend in both IT and marketing and a lot of the investments that we'll be making can go over that normal course. But we are looking forward at what types of bigger investments might we need to make and when we have something to talk about there, we'll let everyone know.

 Your next question comes from the line of Irina Hodakovsky of KeyBanc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Irina Hodakovsky,  KeyBanc Capital Markets - Analyst   [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Two questions for you. The lower floor plan -- lower traffic that you called out in your release, what do you think are the drivers? Is it the lack of the SUVs and trucks you pointed out as a difficult supply right now? Or is it perhaps competition and new entrants into the market who are competing in the stand-alone used vehicle stores?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It's really hard to say, but I do want to point out, we did get enough traffic to sell 340 cars a month per store and it was only slightly down and then conversion was slightly up and we ended up where we ended up. But in terms of traffic through the door, there's a chance that customers are being more prepared and are more likely to buy when they show up. For us, if we could get traffic that's more prepared and more likely to buy, that's just as good for us as it is if we just got plain old extra traffic. So it's not as easy an answer as you might think but we had a lot of traffic in our stores during the quarter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Irina Hodakovsky,  KeyBanc Capital Markets - Analyst   [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Thank you. And one more--
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Just slightly down [from] last year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Irina Hodakovsky,  KeyBanc Capital Markets - Analyst   [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And the second question for you. You mentioned in your opening remarks, one of the headwinds and an impact in the comps was the lower supply of zero- to five-year-old cars. Is that as in general what we've been hearing or are you seeing an actual sequential pullback in this supply from, let's say, in the second or the first quarter?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Actually, when I mentioned supply, I said the supply was down in five- to ten-year-old cars, not zero to five. In five- to ten-year-old cars, it makes sense since the SAR that you're building off of in years six, seven, or eight was dramatically lower than the SAR is today. Remember, we had a SAR as low as 10 in September of 2008 so I was referencing the supply of older cars.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Irina Hodakovsky,  KeyBanc Capital Markets - Analyst   [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you for that clarification. Thank you very much.

 Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani of Evercore.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael Montani,  Evercore ISI - Analyst   [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about, if you could just talk us through how you think about managing the business in terms of balancing inventory turns with gross profit dollars per unit. Generally speaking, some of the publicly traded dealer peers have shown a little bit higher used unit comps, but then have also shown greater erosions in terms of GPUs. So just trying to think through how you would run the business and any tests you may have had tweaking either of those two elements?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We've talked about this in the past. We run pricing tests on a pretty regular basis. You can also see we've been very consistent with the margins that we've been able to achieve. So, look, there's no way to go back and say, look, what if we had lowered prices, how many more cars would we have sold. My guess is we probably gave up a little bit of share by maintaining our prices during the quarter, but it's impossible to quantify.
 I don't think, however, that we gave up gross margin dollars, and I don't think that we -- we try to make the decision that's in the best interest of our shareholders each and every quarter. We did see the decline in margins that some of the other publicly traded auto retailers reported ending September and it maybe helped their comps a little bit, but as far as we're concerned, we can only make the best decision we can with the information that we have and that's what we did during the quarter and we're okay with the results.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael Montani,  Evercore ISI - Analyst   [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Then if I could just follow up on one, which is the leverage point. I believe in the past you've said 4% to 5% being the comp that you would need to show leverage. Obviously, the commentary today is that there's no change to the outlook for future year store growth. Should we assume that's the same because I know there's a lot of initiatives that you guys are working on in terms of costs to try and improve that as well?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We've always said mid-single-digits. We've never really put an exact number on it. It's also dependent on the rate of growth during any given quarter. It's also dependent on the type of growth during the quarter; opening up a big metro market is more expensive than opening up smaller stores, and as you saw during this quarter, there's occasionally some timing of expenses that's going to impact it. But if you think about it over a long period of time, with the growth plan that we have publicly announced, mid-single-digits or so, we can leverage our SG&amp;A dollars.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael Montani,  Evercore ISI - Analyst   [74]

 Thank you.

 Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong of CL King &amp; Associates.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bill Armstrong,  CL King &amp; Associates - Analyst   [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning, Tom. Just getting back to the SUV, light truck mix, if we look at the total industry sales 2012 through 2014, about 50% of total sales were light truck, so call it SUVs and pickups. Your sales and inventory mix clearly is much less. So are you seeing just -- are you not seeing that many of those vehicles available for sale or is it they are maybe not in the condition that you want to re-retail? There seems to be a disconnect there?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Did you say 50% -- I didn't hear what you said about the mix. Did you say 50%?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bill Armstrong,  CL King &amp; Associates - Analyst   [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 50% of all vehicles sold from 2012 to 2014 were light -- classified as light trucks so SUVs and pickups basically.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I hadn't heard that number before, but I believe you, but that's never been the case for us. We've always been in the mid-20s%. This isn't--.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Kenny,  CarMax Inc - VP of IR   [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It's not the same metric.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hold on a second.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Kenny,  CarMax Inc - VP of IR   [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 His metric included cross-over -- it's a much broader--
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Kenny,  CarMax Inc - VP of IR   [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ours is just light trucks -- medium and large SUVs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Our 23% is medium and large SUVs and pickup trucks. The 50% includes crossovers and smaller SUVs so that's not in our number. I don't have the number handy to tell you what the mix was.
 In general, over time, we're going to look a lot like the industry looks. Our sample is very large. We're very widespread across the country and in general we're going to look like the industry looks over time.
 That's where our supply comes from. We're going to match up with consumer demand. It's never going to be exact, particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
 But if you look at what we have historically reported in trucks and SUVs, it's generally been in the mid-20%s, sometimes high 20%s. This quarter it was 23%. It was up a point from the time before, remembering that we're talking about two different measures.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bill Armstrong,  CL King &amp; Associates - Analyst   [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Got it. Do you feel like maybe you're missing some opportunity then with the SUVs, or not necessarily?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, as I said, during the quarter there was a chance that we could have paid more. It's not like the cars weren't out there, but we're always trying to deliver a great value to the consumer, as well. So there are always times when certain things at the auction, we just think they are too expensive and we don't want to buy them and then turn around and resell them, so we wait. The same thing is true here.
 We've been around a long time. We've seen cycles go up and cycles go down. As I mentioned earlier, who knows what happens with gas prices. You hit a big spike in gas prices and there's a good chance our SUV mix would go up during that time because those cars would be cheaper and be a better value to our customers. But I did mention it. During the quarter, we saw that there was a lot of pressure on SUV pricing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bill Armstrong,  CL King &amp; Associates - Analyst   [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it. Okay. That makes sense. If I could just sneak one quick one in. Extended protection plan revenues lag vehicle sales a little bit. Anything to call out there?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Reedy,  CarMax Inc - EVP and CFO   [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nothing in particular. In general, we would expect that business to grow with unit sales. This quarter we had some adjustments in the return reserve. Remember, that's $100 million-plus reserve and so we're going to see small movements in that based on experience as we see it, as it goes forward. Nothing really exciting to report. It's just an adjustment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bill Armstrong,  CL King &amp; Associates - Analyst   [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Thank you.

 Your next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson of Stephens.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nick Zangler,  Stephens Inc. - Analyst   [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is Nick Zangler in for Rick. I was wondering, are you guys considering any changes in the policy of selling recalled vehicles? Obviously, one of the larger dealer groups ceased those sales to enhance their brand name and obviously you guys have a very strong brand name. But any thoughts there? And in general, how do recalled cars affect you operationally?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We talked about this on the last call. Remember, we don't have -- we're not authorized to repair recalls at our stores, and obviously the recall environment has changed over the last several years. We think the most important thing is being completely transparent with our customers and making sure they are fully informed. And also that they register on the manufacturer's website because we could sell them a car today and a recall could come out next week and it wouldn't have mattered whether or not we did anything to the car.
 We think it's very important that they are notified. We're the only car retailer that has a direct link to the NHTSA website and it's VIN-specific and we prepopulate the VIN, so any customer that's on the CarMax website can look up any -- all recall information on each and every individual car.
 Then during the sales process, we make sure that we point out to every customer the recall status. We help them register with the manufacturer, and historically, the relationship, as it relates to recalls, is between the manufacturer and the customer who owns the car. And we want to make sure that customers are fully informed and get that information going forward. So our policy is 100% transparency as it relates to recalls.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nick Zangler,  Stephens Inc. - Analyst   [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Right, right. Understood. Then just in general, where do you guys stand with third-party lead generators? What was the proportion of sales through those sites in the quarter?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We've never talked about proportion of sales, but we've been asked about cars.com and autotrader.com and we have not used those sites for a long time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nick Zangler,  Stephens Inc. - Analyst   [97]

 Okay. Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Whiston,  Morningstar - Analyst   [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, good morning. Wanted to go back to the distinction between SUVs and crossovers. In the crossover side, for vehicles like a RAV-4, CR-V, Chevy Equinox, can you talk a little bit about what pricing you're seeing at auction for those vehicles?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I don't have that information handy, but those are good sellers for us. But I don't have the mix in front of me. I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Whiston,  Morningstar - Analyst   [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What I'm basically asking, are you having any inventory issues there? It sounds like similar to what you were talking about with SUVs. Is that an issue at all?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I don't think so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Whiston,  Morningstar - Analyst   [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. And Tom Reedy, you mentioned before Q&amp;A that you're on the low end of your leverage. Can we infer that you're not going to pay back the incremental revolver borrowing any time soon?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Reedy,  CarMax Inc - EVP and CFO   [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 That's fair to say. The revolver balance is going to be something that's quite seasonal. As you know, we buy up inventory pretty significantly in the fall and we sell through it in the winter and into the spring, so it's there to manage liquidity. But as I mentioned, we've got a target range of leverage we would like to manage to.
 I would expect us to keep adding debt as we go forward and buying back stock to manage to that level. It wouldn't be out of the question for us to do something -- if you think about the revolver -- you look at our conduit facilities on the asset-backed side -- it's something we can use to manage liquidity, but then when you get a critical mass, you take it out with a longer-term instrument.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Whiston,  Morningstar - Analyst   [107]

 Okay. Thank you.

 Your next question comes from the line of Paresh Jain of Morgan Stanley.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paresh Jain,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up on Mike's question earlier. If I'm hearing you right, stable GPU seems to be the more important metric here for CarMax. Am I thinking about it right or how would you characterize your most important metric? Is it comp or is it GPU?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Our most important metric is sales. And then we've just been able to manage gross profit per unit very consistently over time. We want to make sure that we're giving our consumers a great value. One of the things that we are very focused on is continuing to aggressively manage our costs because the price to the consumer is not just the margin, but also the cost that we put into a car during the reconditioning process.
 We continue to put enormous efforts around the engineering that we -- we have turned our reconditioning process into an engineering process and we want to continue to try to figure out how to lower our costs so we can still deliver a great price to the consumer and maintain our margin so that we're delivering a good return for our shareholders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paresh Jain,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Understood. Then on a more strategic front, I wanted to talk about dealer partnerships with ride- and car-sharing businesses. We see some of these businesses -- big and small -- looking to partner with dealers on two fronts, either to buy or sell a car, or in some cases, just utilize a used car sitting on dealer lots and pay dealers a fee.
 How do you feel about these partnerships between ride-sharing firms and dealer businesses? Are there potential hurdles in this type of arrangement or maybe there are no issues and it makes sense to use money on used cars while it's sitting on the lot?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We haven't really explored those avenues for us. The one thing I would say is it is an incredibly fragmented business and a huge marketplace. There are over 40 million used cars sold annually in the US. We're a very small fraction of that. So as I said, we haven't looked at those things in particular, but we try to pay attention to all the things that are available in the marketplace and see if we think they are an opportunity for us.
 But right now, our biggest opportunity is to continue to grow the business in markets that we're not in, continue to add stores back into places where we already have a presence. We're only reaching about 60% of the US population. We have incredible growth in front of us, and right now those are the kinds of things that we're focused on.

 Your next question comes from the line of Robert Iannarone of RBC Markets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Iannarone,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [115]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hi, guys. Rob Iannarone on for Scot Ciccarelli. Just a couple of quick questions for you. Some of the credit data that we've tracked has indicated outsized burden with 72-month plus financing arm. Just wondering if you could give us any commentary on what you're seeing in customer behavior and their desire for longer-term loans for their vehicles?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Reedy,  CarMax Inc - EVP and CFO   [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, the way I can respond to that is that, like I said, we're going to be a market-driven lender at CAF and we're going to make sure we're doing the best thing for our customers. It's always a balancing act. We're going to be continually testing and see when it makes sense.
 Recent -- the data that you might be pointing to, recent Experian data shows about 15% of used volumes getting done at terms longer than 72. We're not sure how much of that is actually pushing out more than a couple months, but as I said, we'll stay competitive. If we see the need to move, we will, but at this point, we don't feel compelled to rush into any long-term financing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Iannarone,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Great, thanks. Just one more on advertising. Second quarter in a row now, we've seen advertising expense tick up. You've certainly commented on this in the last couple of calls for us. Just wondering if we should expect that to normalize going forward now that you are in the Boston market and you've launched this new campaign?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, we're going to make decisions throughout the quarter, as well, but as I said, this increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis would not be typical for us.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Iannarone,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [119]

 Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Fassler,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [122]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks a lot. I got back in line and there was room. I have two follow-ups for you. The first relates to write-downs. What can you talk about in terms of the drivers of the tick-up and write-downs? How would you relate it to underwriting standards?
 You talked about seeing higher quality credit applications, et cetera. Just give us a sense, if you could, about how to think about those write-downs and how we might model them out from here?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Reedy,  CarMax Inc - EVP and CFO   [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Are you talking about CAF losses?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Fassler,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [124]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Correct?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Reedy,  CarMax Inc - EVP and CFO   [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'm sorry, Matt. Yes, what I mentioned about the flows in the quarter was that it was a quarterly -- this quarter phenomenon. For the last several, several, several quarters, in fact, most of them we've seen growth in all areas in the credit spectrum. This quarter, we saw decline in application volume in lower FICO stuff and a continued growth in the higher-end stuff, the 650-plus. That's what I meant by the traffic.
 That's unrelated to what's going on with charge-offs. Charge-offs has to do what's in the portfolio and what's been put in there over the last several years. The way I characterize it is we've had a long string of favorable experience. At some point, it was -- the tide was going to turn and things were probably going to normalize.
 I would probably characterize it as giving back some of the favorable experience we've had over the last several quarters. It's too early to tell what that means from a go-forward perspective, but as I mentioned, the reserve balance today is at the same level as a percent of receivables as it was last year.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Fassler,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [126]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Is there anything that you saw in recent delinquency data that would lead you to be incrementally concerned or do you feel like the book is still in very good shape?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Reedy,  CarMax Inc - EVP and CFO   [127]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 As I said, we've got a quarter's worth of data and we'll take it as it comes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Fassler,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [128]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it. Then my next question, just you bought back an awful lot of stock during what was obviously a tough quarter. What would you need to see? What would it take in terms of the fundamentals of the business to lead you to slow that buyback down?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Reedy,  CarMax Inc - EVP and CFO   [129]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matt, as I said, we've got into the lower end of the leverage range that we've been targeting, and on a go-forward basis we'll continue to do it to manage the capital structure going forward. I can't comment on what would compel us to do anything, because market conditions could be -- in the future could be all over the Board. I just think you should take away that we're going to continue using it.
 We're going to continue using a programmatic approach. You saw during the quarter that we stepped up volume based on what the stock price did. But on a go-forward basis, it's probably more of managing the structure perspective rather than moving to a new capital structure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Fassler,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [130]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it. Thank you very much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tom Folliard,  CarMax Inc - President and CEO   [131]
