 Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Chubb Corporation's third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Before we begin, Chubb has asked me to make the following statements. In order to help you understand Chubb, its industry and its results, members of Chubb's Management Team will include in today's presentation forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report that we had record operating income per share of $1.98 for the third quarter and a record $5.04 for the first nine months. Our outstanding third quarter benefited from strong ex-CAT underwriting results as well as unusually low catastrophe losses. At the same time, we continued to achieve rate increases in all of our businesses. These positive factors were more than enough to offset the continuing effects of a challenging global economic environment and the impact of low interest rates. Third quarter operating income per share of $1.98 resulted in annualized operating ROE of 15.5%. The combined ratio for the quarter was 86.3% compared to 102.6% last year. Excluding CAT, the combined ratio for the third quarter was 85.7% in 2012, 2.5 points better than 88.2% for the last year third quarter. Net income per share for the third quarter of 2012 was the same as operating income per share. Annualized ROE for the quarter was 13.5%.
 GAAP book value per share at September 30 was $60.99, that's a 9% increase since year-end 2011 and a 10% increase since September 30 a year ago. Our capital position is excellent and we continue to make good progress on our share repurchase program. Net written premiums for the third quarter were up 1% driven by Chubb Personal and Chubb Commercial Insurance, which were up 3% and 2% respectively. Growth at CPI and CCI was partially offset by a 4% decline in Chubb Specialty premiums. Excluding the impact of currency translation, net written premiums for Chubb overall were up 3%. Given our strong results in the first nine months and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we have raised our operating income per share guidance for the full year to a range of $6.70 to $6.80 per share, which is an increase of $0.92 at the midpoint. Let me now turn it over to Paul, who will discuss the performance of Chubb's Commercial and Specialty Insurance operations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Krump,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Commercial &amp; Specialty Lines   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, John. At Chubb Commercial Insurance, net written premiums for the third quarter were up 2% to $1.2 billion. Combined ratio was 87.2% versus 101.1% in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's third quarter combined ratio was 87%, compared to 89.9% in the third quarter of 2011. We are pleased that CCI's average US renewal rates in the third quarter increased by 8%, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of rate increases for CCI. This compares to the 9% we obtained in this year's second quarter, with a slight decline primarily attributable to small differences in the mix of business available for renewal in the third quarter. What is especially encouraging is the fact that this year's 8% is solid rate on rate, as it comes on top of the 4% average rate increase we secured in the third quarter of 2011. CCI achieved US renewal rate increases in each line of business in the third quarter of 2012.
 Workers' compensation rates increased the most, with a low double-digit average, followed by monoline property, general liability, package, excess umbrella, automobile, boiler and marine. Viewed from an account perspective, we continued to achieve broad based pricing improvement with some 90% of our renewals receiving rate increases in the third quarter, the same as in the second quarter. Let me now turn to CCI markets outside of the US, where market acceptance of higher rates continues to lag the United States. In Canada, average renewal rates were up by low single-digits in the third quarter, which was down slightly from the second quarter. In Europe, average renewal rates were up by low single-digits in the third quarter, matching what occurred in the second quarter of the year.
 CCI continued to obtain rate increases in Australia, along with some of our other markets in Asia. Average renewal rates in Latin America were flat in the third quarter. CCI's third quarter US renewal retention was 84%, identical to the second quarter of this year. Continued strong renewal rate increases and solid retention aided CCI's quarterly premium growth, while new business was also up slightly. CCI's new to loss business ratio in the US remained at 0.9 to 1 in the third quarter, identical to the second quarter of the year. Midterm endorsement and premium audits were slightly positive, but did not have a significant impact on this quarter's growth, while renewal exposure change was slightly negative.
 At Chubb's Specialty Insurance, net written premiums declined 4% in the third quarter to $640 million and the combined ratio was 91.9%, compared to 88.3% in the year-earlier third quarter. For the Professional Liability portion of CSI, net written premiums were down 5% to $567 million and the combined ratio was 97%, slightly improved from the first six months when it was 98.2%. In the third quarter of 2011, the combined ratio for Professional Liability was 92.5%. We are pleased that average renewal rates for Professional Liability in the US increased by 8% in the third quarter, continuing the positive momentum that began in the fourth quarter of last year. The 8% increase in the third quarter was the strongest quarterly renewal rate increase since 2003 and compares to a 7% increase in the second quarter this year and negative 1% in the third quarter of 2011. In each of our Professional Liability lines of business in the United States, average renewal rates increased in the third quarter. Increases were led by private company D&amp;O which experienced average rate increases in the mid-teens, followed by EPL, crime, not-for-profit D&amp;O, public D&amp;O, E&amp;O and fiduciary.
 In markets outside of the US, average renewal rates for Professional Liability improved modestly in the third quarter, with average increases in the low single-digits. Renewal premium retention for Professional Liability in the third quarter was 82% in the US, identical to the second quarter. The new to loss business ratio for Professional Liability in the US was 0.6 to 1, compared to 0.7 to 1 in the second quarter of the year. While Professional Liability submissions have increased, we remain steadfast in quoting prices to potential new customers that will earn an adequate return. As we discussed in last quarter's call, we are willing to accept a decline in new Professional Liability business and overall growth as we reprofile the book for improved profitability. Regarding the surety portion of our CSI book, net written premiums in the third quarter were up 3% to $73 million and the combined ratio was 55.8%. With that, I will turn it over to Dino, who will review our Personal lines results as well as corporate-wide Claims.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dino Robusto,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Personal Lines &amp; Claims   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Paul. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premium increased to 3% in the third quarter to $1.1 billion. CPI produced a combined ratio of 82.8% compared to 115.6% in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI's third quarter was 1.5 points in 2012, whereas last year we had a third quarter catastrophe toll of 28.5 points. On an ex-CAT basis CPI's combined ratio was 81.3% in the third quarter of this year, compared to 87.1% in the third quarter of 2011, reflecting continued strong underwriting performance across all geographies and product lines. Homeowner's premiums grew 3% for the quarter and the combined ratio was 76.2% compared to 126.1% in the corresponding quarter last year. CAT losses accounted for only 2.4 points of the Homeowner's combined ratio in the third quarter of 2012, compared to 44.7 points in the third quarter of 2011.
 Excluding CATs, the third quarter Homeowner's combined ratio was a very strong 73.8% in 2012, a 7.6 point improvement over the same period a year ago, when it was 81.4%. Roughly half of the improvement in the ex-CAT combined ratio reflects the fact that we had fewer non-CAT weather-related losses than we had in the third quarter a year ago. Non-CAT weather-related losses in the US in the third quarter of this year accounted for about 3.5 points of the Homeowner's combined ratio, compared to about 7 points in the year-ago third quarter. Personal Auto premiums declined 2% because the negative impact of currency translation more than offset the increase in premiums in local currencies. Personal Auto is a relatively small book of business for us with a large portion outside the US, so it can be heavily influenced by currency fluctuations.
 Excluding the currency impact, premiums outside the US increased as did premiums in the US, consistent with the growth rate in recent quarters. The combined ratio for Personal Auto improved to 92%, more than 7 points better than the third quarter a year ago, when it was 99.3%. In Other Personal lines, premiums were up 8% driven by strong growth in our Accident and Personal Excess Liability lines. The combined ratio for Other Personal improved to 95.5% from 97.6% in the third quarter a year ago. In the US, the third quarter of 2012 was the eighth consecutive quarter of growth in policy count for both Homeowner's and Personal Auto. At the end of the quarter, policy count for Homeowner's was 1% higher than a year earlier and for Auto it was 3% higher. Policy retention was consistent with the second quarter of this year, at 91% for Homeowner's and 89% for Auto. In short, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Personal lines.
 Turning now to Claims, corporate-wide, in the third quarter of 2012 the impact of catastrophe losses was $17 million before tax, accounting for 0.6 points of the combined ratio. The $17 million reflects $33 million of losses before tax, from third quarter CAT events in the US, primarily Hurricane Isaac, partially offset by downward revisions to our estimated losses from catastrophes in the first half of 2012. Development of catastrophes prior to 2012 had no significant impact. In the third quarter of 2011, we had CAT losses of $420 million before tax accounting for 14.4 percentage points of the combined ratio. For the first nine months of 2012, catastrophe losses were $264 million before tax or 3 points of the combined ratio. This compares with $1 billion or 11.7 points in the first nine months of 2011. Now, I'll turn it over to Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ricky Spiro,  Chubb Corp - EVP and CFO   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Dino. As you've already heard, we had an excellent third quarter. Looking first at our operating results, we had strong underwriting income of $418 million in the quarter. Property and Casualty investment income after tax was down 7% to $297 million in the quarter, due primarily to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolios. The impact of foreign currency translation also had a negative impact on our investment results. Going forward, we expect Property and Casualty investment income after tax to decline in the fourth quarter as well as next year, as we continue to reinvest maturing securities at much lower reinvestment rates.
 Net income was the same as operating income in the quarter, as net realized gains from the sale of securities were offset by net realized losses from our alternative investments. For comparison, in the third quarter of 2011, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $71 million or $0.16 per share after tax. As a reminder, we account for our alternative investments on a quarter lag because of the time required to receive updated valuations from the investment managers of limited partnerships. Accordingly, our alternative investment results for the third quarter, reflected the negative global equity market performance in the second quarter. Our fourth quarter 2012 results will reflect market performance in the third quarter which was more favorable. Unrealized depreciation before tax at September 30, 2012 increased by $352 million in the quarter to $3.2 billion. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $44.1 billion as of September 30, 2012. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.6 years and the average credit rating is Aa2.
 We also continue to have excellent liquidity at the Holding Company. At September 30, our Holding Company portfolio including $2.2 billion of investment, including approximately $560 million of short-term investment. Book value per share under GAAP at September 30, 2012 was $60.99, compared to $56.15 at year end 2011 and $55.25 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized costs was $53.96, compared to $50.37 at 2011 year-end and $50.13 a year ago. As for Reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the third quarter of 2012 on prior year Reserves by SBU as follows -- in CPI, we had approximately $25 million; CCI had $70 million; CSI had $35 million; and reinsurance assumed had $15 million, bringing the total favorable development to approximately $145 million for the quarter.
 This represents a favorable impact on the third quarter combined ratio of about 5 points overall. For comparison, in the third quarter of 2011, we had about $155 million of favorable development for the Company overall, including -- $5 million in CPI; $95 million in CCI; $45 million in CSI; and $10 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the third quarter of 2011 was also about 5 points. For the third quarter of 2012, our ex-CAT accident year combined ratio was a very strong 90.6%, compared to 93.4% in last year's third quarter. During the third quarter, our loss reserves increased by $20 million including an increase of $53 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $33 million for the reinsurance assumed business which is in run-off. The overall increases in Reserves reflects a decrease of about $140 million related to catastrophe. The impact of currency translation on loss Reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in Reserves of about $60 million.
 Turning to capital management. During the third quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares at an aggregate cost of $301 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $73.80 per share. For the first nine months of the year, we repurchased 12.7 million shares for a total of $907 million with an average cost of $71.23 per share. As of September 30, 2012, we had $357 million available for share repurchases under our current authorization and as we have said previously, we intend to complete this program by the end of January 2013. Let me conclude with a few comments on the revised guidance we announced in today's press release. Based on the low level of catastrophe losses in the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are revising our 2012 full year operating income per share guidance to a range of $6.70 to $6.80, from the previous guidance range of $5.70 to $5.95.
 This revised guidance is based on operating income per share of $5.04 in the first nine months and a range of $1.66 to $1.76 for the fourth quarter. The revised guidance assumes 2 percentage points of CATs for the fourth quarter, which would result in 2.7 points of CATs for the calendar year. This compares to the full year CAT assumption of 4.3 points included in our previous guidance. The decrease being due to the lower than expected CATs in the third quarter. The impact on operating income per share of each point of CATs is approximately $0.28 for the full year and approximately $0.07 for the fourth quarter. The revised guidance is also based on an assumption of 271 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year, unchanged from our previous guidance. Now, I'll turn it back to John.

 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Ricky. Let me summarize a few of the key highlights of the third quarter. We had operating income of $533 million or a record $1.98 per share. Our annualized ROE was 13.5% and annualized operating ROE was 15.5%. We produced an ex-CAT combined ratio of 85.7% and an ex-CAT, accident year combined ratio of 90.6%. GAAP book value per share at September 30, 2012 was $60.99, up 10% from a year earlier and up 9% from year-end 2011. We repurchased $301 million of common shares and paid $110 million in dividends. We continue to secure rate increases in all three business units, maintaining upward momentum on an earned premium basis. For the first nine months of 2012, operating income totaled $1.4 billion. On a per share basis operating income for the first nine months was $5.04 per share, a 44% increase over last year and the highest nine month operating income per share in Chubb history.
 Annualized operating ROE for the first nine months was 13.4%. For the first nine months was -- annualized ROE for the first nine months was 12.3%. The combined ratio for the first nine months was 90.1% and the ex-CAT combined ratio was 87.1%. Our strong performance in first nine months of the year has enabled us to increase our 2012 operating income per share guidance to a range of $6.70 to $6.80. The midpoint of our revised guidance is $0.92 per share higher than the midpoint of our prior guidance of $5.70 to $5.95. In summary, we had a great third quarter on a top of a very good first half. We continue to be encouraged by marketplace rate trends. With that, I'll open the line to your questions.

 First, CCI insurance pricing, appears to have modestly decelerated from 9% to 8%. Should we -- is there a read-through there? Would you say 2Q was likely the peak for pricing outside of a large industry loss? Switching gears to Professional and Personal lines, if you could also comment on the rate environments and your outlooks there. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Krump,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Commercial &amp; Specialty Lines   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Mike, hi, this is Paul. I think it's fair to say that in the US, CCI renewal rate increase has been in a tight range for the last few quarters, running between 8% and 9%. The slight down tick from the second quarter to the third quarter is really attributable more to business mix differences between the quarters than any change in the marketplace condition. For example, in Q3 we had fewer large commercial real estate property accounts available to be renewed than we had in Q2. That really is what drove the change. As respects, where rates are going forward, obviously no one knows for certain. But where we sit, the macro factors which are contributing to the push for rates for the entire P&amp;C industry, the need for rate increases haven't changed. The low reinvestment yields, the years of soft market pricing, we don't see that changing any time soon.
 I think that we were fortunate, we had a very benign CAT quarter as an industry. But no one here at least in Warren, New Jersey is extrapolating that into the future. We're going to continue to push for rates, very hard. As respects, specialty you asked about, we continue to see nice momentum there. We continue to work on the book of business, not only from a rate perspective but also from a reprofiling. Once again, this past quarter, we saw in our 1-star accounts, which happen to be the tier with the least amount or the most rate need, we had over 35 points of rate in that tier. We only had 65% retention whereby in the 4- and 5-star accounts, the best accounts, we still took positive rate in the low single-digits and had nearly 90% retention. We're doing a good job of reprofiling that book and it needs to be reprofiled.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Let me just say generally, we don't have final October numbers. We're not going to make any predictions. But what we can say is anecdotal, we have not heard anything in the marketplace that would suggest that a significant change has occurred in the rate environment. In terms of CPI, we're filing for additional rate increases, so that momentum continues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Zaremski,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. That's helpful. Lastly, in regards to the increased 4Q guidance, the math I'm doing points to an expectation for improved margins on an ex-CAT, ex-prior year development basis. Would you agree with that? If so, can you comment on what's driving that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, there would be no way you could interpolate what ex-CAT accident year would be, because there's no breakout of favorable development versus accident year. What we can say is we don't split them up. If you looked at our combined ratio guidance for the fourth quarter, you would see that first of all, we have assumed 2 points of CATs, so that's versus 0.6 points in the third quarter. So clearly that adversely affects us in a quarterly comparison. Then we're basically an ex-CAT basis, on a combined ratio looking at a combined ratio in line with our first half experience which is a couple points higher than we had in the third quarter.

 So on Professional Liability, it sounds like you're making pretty substantial progress. One, I wonder if you'd just talk -- I'm going to focus my question on this. But I wondered if you could give us up some color as to what you're seeing in terms of new Claims reports and the severities on the open Claims and basically give us an update on the issues you identified last year that led you to raise your loss picks and sort of sound the alarm bell. Then also, would love to more broadly get your sense of what kind of guidance you're giving to your brokers and ultimately through the broader community around 1/1 renewals on D&amp;O. How much rate, maybe not so much you think that the market will bear because that's speculative, but how much rate would Chubb like to take?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'll start with a little bit of insight on the Claim activity on the Professional Liability, give you a little general overview. In terms of Professional Liability, [newer rise account] increased about 6% in the quarter and about 3% for the nine months of 2012. These increases are largely attributable to EPL which was up about 23% for the quarter and 18% for nine months. Now, the increase in EPL Claim count has been a multi-year trend, principally reflecting the ongoing employment practice's administrative charges. Other than EPL, Professional Liability newer rise accounts are actually down 11% both for the quarter and for the first nine months. Then just in terms of severity for Professional Liability, we obviously look at severity a little bit differently than we do, say, Auto or Homeowner's where you have a large number of consistent claims. Here, what we're looking at are leading indicators such as security class action filings.
 On that front, based on new filings for the industry in the first nine months it appears that traditional security class action activity on an annualized basis is at a comparable level to last year which is up from the historical lows we saw a couple years ago. Given than the security class action activity has historically been the driver of our public and financial institution, but do you know what? This is clearly a trend we watch carefully. In the EPL that I referenced that was up on account, when you look at it from a severity standpoint, at the length of time to find a job has increased, the damages asserted primarily back pay and defense costs have increased. However, it's important to note that the majority of the filings we are seeing that is driving the increased claim count are lower severity cases. That's just a little bit of detail on the Personal Liability trends. Paul?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Krump,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Commercial &amp; Specialty Lines   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Josh, it's Paul. I'll try to add some color then about -- I guess it was really what we're thinking about as respects 1/1 renewals and what are we talking to our field people about. I think we have alluded to this in the past, that we think first about a product line and the dynamics that we talked about before, some of the issues around D&amp;O and the EPL and crime are certainly still with us as we go into 1/1. But then what we really do, Josh, is we make it very granular. We look at it by geography, by SIC type, we put it through our tiering, proprietary models and we take it down to an individual policy level. We look at that account, but we ask ourselves, what is the starting point for the rate?
 How does that compare to like, kind and quality within our book? How well is that individual account been running? We set a target rate increase or maybe it might even be flat, depending on how well it's performing, as we go into the season. So while we do have overall targets, it's really very granular when we take it out to talk to our field staff and with the agents. Then when we talk to the agents, we make certain that we talk to them about a lot of their accounts that are coming up so that they don't misread any signal on a particular account as meaning it impacts their entire book of business. So I hope that gives you some flavor of what we're doing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I think, generally, we're booking 102%, so we need a good deal of rate increases going into 2012.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Josh Stirling,  Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. - Analyst   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Right. Thank you. The final question I ask would be on workers' comp, you've had a couple quarters in a row now, pretty substantial growth. I think there's been some explanations before but would love to get a sense of -- are you guys expanding your appetite here or is this not historically been a place you have been focused.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Krump,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Commercial &amp; Specialty Lines   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, I can definitively tell you we're not expanding our appetite for workers' comp. A big part of the growth is driven by rate. Another piece of the growth came in workers' compensation from audit premiums and exposure growth. The overall book saw a little bit of a decline in exposure but workers' comp had a bit of an exposure in audit growth in it. I told you when we -- in my prepared remarks about the rate increases, workers' compensation was in the low double-digits, so that gives you a sense of it. As far as new business goes, it was up slightly but our in-force count, Josh, is only up 1% in workers' compensation. So we're sticking to our knitting. We're trying to see some opportunities there. But really, it's being rate-driven which is exactly what we want to see.

 First, one for Ricky. Given the continued impact of low interest rates on investment income, what do you think the after tax annualized yield on the portfolio could be a year from now if rates stay at current levels with it being 3.08% in the third quarter of 2012?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ricky Spiro,  Chubb Corp - EVP and CFO   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, Jay, I don't know that I can give you an exact number. I guess what I can tell you as we sit here today, as we think about reinvestment rates and where we're putting money to work today, it obviously varies by asset class. On average, we're reinvesting our maturing securities at about 175 basis points lower than the maturing book yield. In our 10-K, you have a maturity schedule of our fixed income securities, so that would give you some sense of what would happen to yield over time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Gelb,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Is that 175 below, you're talking about the after tax yield or is that pretax?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ricky Spiro,  Chubb Corp - EVP and CFO   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Pretax, I believe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Gelb,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ricky Spiro,  Chubb Corp - EVP and CFO   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Pretax.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Gelb,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All right. Then the second one and I know we've discussed this before, is the pace of the buyback. Chubb's been buying $300 million of stock back a quarter, which is on track to be well below the buyback pace in 2011 or 2010, despite the level of operating earnings being at least as high as those prior two years, so I'm just trying to understand what Chubb is doing with the excess capital its retaining if not buying back stock.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ricky Spiro,  Chubb Corp - EVP and CFO   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sure. Well, look, as you say, we're on course to complete our buyback by the end of January. Let me give you a brief word of explanation. Because when we put this program in place back in January, we gave you some idea that when we thought about our buyback, we were looking at our operating income, less shareholder dividends as a general guideline for us as we make our buyback decision. Not a precise level at which we buy back shares in a given year. So when we set the initial buyback target of $1.2 billion back in January, at that point we were projecting 2012 operating income in the amount of about $1.5 billion and shareholder dividends of about $400 million. So at that time we said that we would be buying back about $100 million more than our forecasted operating income less shareholder dividends. Obviously as you point out, our forecast has gone up. We're now expecting about $1.8 billion in operating income for the year and when you take out shareholder dividends, we're now going to have about $200 million more than our buyback program.
 We have no intention of increasing our 2012 buyback program at this time, beyond what we said originally. This excess $200 million in net retained earnings will go into our year end capital position and will be one of the factors going into consideration of our buyback program for 2013. You might recall that our year end capital position will also be affected by the impact of interest rates on our investment portfolio, the change in our pension position due to returns and lower interest rates and the impact of currency on the carrying value of our balance sheet, among other things. So the resulting excess capital position will be our starting point in the development of our 2013 share buyback program. We'll then factor in among other things -- overall market conditions; our expected earnings and dividend flows; our stock price valuation; alternative investment opportunities; and potential opportunities for profitable growth to come up with a final level of any stock buyback program. So bottom line is we continue to think we're in very strong excess capital position and we'll take all that into consideration as we head into 2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay, basically our baseline position is that the buybacks should be about the amount of income less shareholder dividends. A couple of years ago, we were opportunistic and bought back more shares than that. You had a very attractive price valuation. We continue to like the value of our stock, but that was an opportunistic play. It doesn't -- it's obvious that you cannot buy back a lot more shares than you're increase in a [tick], returning earnings from net incomes over a long period of time. That can only be an opportunistic play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Gelb,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I see. You have a lot of high class problems, here. With the stock trading at 135% of book, does that give you any pause on the valuation side?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We think it's still an attractive valuation, but of course when we looked at it in 2010 at 110% of book, it looked like a more attractive valuation and we did have a significant excess capital position and took advantage of that opportunity. 135% is about our historical average over the last 10 years, so it's high compared to where it's been in the last few years, but over time it's not particularly high.

 Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Newsome,  Sandler O'Neill Asset Management - Analyst   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I want to play devil's advocate a little bit here and talk about some of the lines that looked like they're at adequate, like maturity and some of the commercial lines business, [multi-peril] casualty. Should we be thinking of lower rate increases and faster growth given that you're sort of at rate adequacy. Or is there something that I'm thinking that should be more complicated than that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 How are you deriving your conclusions as to rate adequate, based upon current period combined ratio?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Newsome,  Sandler O'Neill Asset Management - Analyst   [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, I mean, not -- this year the combined ratio so far for those volumes are really quite good, knock on wood. You put through a fairly substantial rate this year. As we think of next year, not necessarily next quarter, how do you think -- maybe if I asked another way, how do you think of that tradeoff of trying to get through rate in an environment where you can get rate versus trying to grow?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I think, and I'm going to let Paul answer this, I don't think you can necessarily -- the analyses, by just looking at the current combined ratio won't get you there. We'll have to look at what favorable development there. What catastrophes are there. What weather-related impacts are there. The new money impact and lower investment income which is coming in. Paul, why don't you talk about it a little.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Krump,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Commercial &amp; Specialty Lines   [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, sure, John, I'll try to frame it out here a little bit. But Paul, thanks for the question. I certainly appreciate you playing devil's advocate on it. Maybe just taking a step back, when we think about rate adequacy, we start by a product line. We will modify it by geography, industry segment, a lot of subsets of those and the analyses are constantly revised as new data becomes available. We look at stuff like loss projections, claim costs, payout patterns, frequency trends, as well as what the pricing direction, what our field might be telling us about terms and conditions, et cetera. While I greatly appreciate that you've noticed we made solid progress towards our goals, as evidenced by the excellent third quarter results. I caution you just to remember that in the third quarter in particular the results include significant favorable development.
 You've got investment income there that still reflects a higher embedded yield, as well as obviously unusually low CAT. Then when you think about it on an accident year basis, the overall book is not currently at adequate rate levels to achieve what we consider our long run normalized CAT load combined ratio target. So we're looking at a lot of stuff. One of the other factors we have to think about all the time is the pressure from loss costs, where the trend is at by line. If you just think about commercial in general, let's pick a number. We could debate it. But we tend to think around maybe 4% as a loss cost trend on the book of business. That means we as underwriters have to step up every year and get at least 4% on average just to tread water. So that's a force that you're always swimming against, so-to-speak. Hopefully that gives you some sense. We've made good progress but bottom line, we think we've got a ways to go.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Newsome,  Sandler O'Neill Asset Management - Analyst   [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So to kind of focus this a little bit in my mind, it sounds like you believe that you still need to take your current book and make it more profitable overall. So the focus is going to continue to be on trying to get rate as opposed to growth.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. Let's look at it this way. I think if you did an analysis -- let's talk about the macro and you can move to the individual lines. It's a little different. But if you did an analysis, a rigorous analysis of what our overall book has generated on an accident year basis, with normalized CATs, our overall business, you would still be lucky to get the double-digits. We obviously are benefiting from very low CATs in this quarter and still a good deal of favorable development. Now, so is all of the industry and the industry's -- if we're at the high single-digits, the industry's well below that. So from an overall perspective, we're not rate adequate. Now are there some lines that are better than others? Of course.
 We undertake continuously analyses of each of the lines of what kind of rates we need in each of the lines and the profitability versus growth tradeoff. That's sort of at a granular level that we do here and in the field. So each line is different. But as Paul mentioned, that even if you got the rate adequacy, the day you stopped and don't get any more rate, you're 4% inadequate the following year. So you need rate all of the time. We don't have a lot of lines that are excessively profitable. We have a few that may be rate adequate. But overall, you'd have to say that an accident year basis with a full CAT load and normal weather-related activity, we're not at target ROEs for the book as a whole.

 Vinay Misquith, Evercore Partners.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vinay Misquith,  Evercore Partners - Analyst   [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The first question is on the accident year margins, you mentioned there was some benefit from lower than average non-CAT weather. So was this quarter's non-CAT weather much better than normal? The reason I ask is, historically the accident year loss rate ex-CATs is worse in the second half of the year versus the first half. This year we actually saw the reversal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We don't -- let me talk. What I'd say is this, Vinay, we had a good quarter. Margin expansion is usually defined as the amount by which rate increases exceed longer term cost trends. It's kind of a hypothetical calculation. In any given quarter, you're never at longer term loss trends, you're at something else. But if you look at where our third quarter results came from -- if you talked about earned premium which is what gets into income, we were close to margin neutral in the third quarter in CPI and CSI and had about 2 points of margin expansion in CCI, hypothetically. So, by itself it's a positive number, but not sufficient on its own to explain our actual third quarter accident results, note a 3 point overall improvement from the third quarter 2011. Where did it come from?
 A little bit from that, the margin expansion in CCI perhaps, but more that the actual losses in the quarter were below the regression line, below the long-term trend line. We'd liked to think that's a largely attributable to excellent underwriting on our part and maybe in part it is. But we also recognize there are some good fortune involvement. One of the pieces of good fortune, we use it as an example, there are other pieces, that is non-Cat related weather. That's primarily a Personal line thing with a little bit of rollover to Commercial Property, multiple peril lines. But, for example, to give you an idea, in our Homeowner's business non-CAT US weather-related losses ran at about 3.5 points in the third quarter, versus 7 points in the third quarter of 2011 and about 6 points in the third quarters over the last five years. As you look forward, and I know all you will try to do this, you would look at -- we might at the continued rate levels, we might have theoretically 3 points of margin expansion in 2013 over all our businesses.
 But you have to remember, we're starting with a very favorable loss period. So it would be kind of simplistic just to extrapolate that expansion. It would assume that actual loss experience in the quarter will continue below longer term cost trends for the next year. A possible, but not probable assumption. A more realistic assumption might include offsetting the margin expansions a little bit by some reversion to the mean and higher losses from a variety of areas. Margin analysis is a good forecasting tool. But you've got to look at where the base period is. You've got to look at the actual versus the theoretical. Then finally, when you look at income forecasts you've got to recognize that margin expansion generally applies on what an accident year results, which doesn't affect favorable development. That's another major component of [calendar] results, note it to take into account changes in investment income of course.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vinay Misquith,  Evercore Partners - Analyst   [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 That's helpful. Could you help us understand what rate increases you're looking for on the Homeowner's line?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ricky Spiro,  Chubb Corp - EVP and CFO   [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We're in the process now of filing Homeowner rate increase that vary by state, of course, in the mid single-digit and above level, with targeted effective dates in the next two quarters. I use the word targeted, just because they're still subject to regulatory approval. But that's the range we're looking at.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vinay Misquith,  Evercore Partners - Analyst   [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. That's great. Then, just one last thing if I may. On the net investment income I believe last quarter it was said that the new yields on the tax exempt securities are between 125 to 150 basis points lower and on the taxable securities it's about 250 basis points lower. So just wondering if it still holds or if it's -- or the new money is even worse now than it was last quarter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Krump,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Commercial &amp; Specialty Lines   [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The new money rates are a little bit worse than they were last quarter, so as we sit here now on the muni side we're probably looking at roughly 160 basis points lower. On the domestic taxable side, we're looking at about 300 basis points lower. Then on our non-US fixed income investments we're looking at about 150 basis points lower. As I mentioned in a prior comment, you look at it on average it's probably about 175 basis points across the portfolio.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vinay, you can see that contraction in spreads and the mirror image of it is the improvement in the position -- in our unrealized position, which increased substantially over the quarter. Only part due to equities and part due to the fact that spreads came in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Just a couple questions. One, in CCI, it looked like the underlying loss ratio was a lot lower. Specifically CMP, the underlying combined was pretty low and marine looked pretty low. Is there some lumpiness that kind of I think someone made the comment before about -- in CPI, that there was a lack of lumpiness, is that part of the reason for that or is there something else? Just one follow-up. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Krump,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Commercial &amp; Specialty Lines   [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is Paul, Mike. I think it's really when you look at it, it probably -- the impact of CAT.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Nannizzi,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So it's just CATs? There's nothing even on an underlying basis that really had an impact there?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Krump,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Commercial &amp; Specialty Lines   [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, we are seeing some improvement, yes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Our accident year ex-CAT results in CCI were an improvement, definitely, in all of our lines of business.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Nannizzi,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 But remember, last year, as I think it was a huge quarter for CATs. So you can't -- the third quarter -- if the published results are going to be so misleading that you really can't draw much from those.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Nannizzi,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. But even -- yes, I guess even if you compare going back, it's a unique result. I was just curious if there was -- non-CAT weather was a driver as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No. I mean, I don't think that much. I think that CATs were unusually low and we also had very favorable ex-CAT accident year results in our commercial lines. We've had good loss trends this year. Now, you go back a few years and we had better results, but these are very good.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Krump,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Commercial &amp; Specialty Lines   [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The other think, Mike, is that property, mono prop, package prop have been leading the rate parade for us for the last five quarters. You're seeing a little of that start to earn its way in a little bit too.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Nannizzi,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it. Then, Ricky, could you give a little more of a breakdown in terms of the development by -- either by accident year or maybe just within CCI, by product type or just maybe some general notion of where the development came from?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ricky Spiro,  Chubb Corp - EVP and CFO   [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sure. Happy to do that. So I'll go through each of the SBUs and then give you as much color as I can. I'll start with CPI where we had about $25 million of favorable development. In CPI, all three of our lines of business, Homeowner's, Auto and Other Personal were slightly favorable in the quarter. When you look at CCI where we had the $70 million, it was driven largely by our Casualty book and our Commercial multi-peril book was also favorable. Workers' comp was close to flat and Property Marine actually was slightly adverse. Then in CSI with $35 million of favorable development, the vast majority of the favorable was in the Professional Liability lines driven by D&amp;O and fiduciary and it was partially offset by some small adverse development in client fidelity, E&amp;O and EPL, reflecting some of the trends that we've already talked about.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mike Nannizzi,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Accident years, is it recent years or older years? Just generally, or --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Krump,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Commercial &amp; Specialty Lines   [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Primarily 2008 and prior.

 Matthew Heimermann,  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. - Analyst   [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 First question I had was just, if I think about guidance at the start of the year and adjusting for CATs and NI and all these other changes, I have kind of the midpoint about $0.70 higher than where you started. My question is relative to the base cases you had at the beginning of the year, what areas were you positively surprised in? I guess I was thinking kind of how much of it was better development, how much of it was perhaps better loss trend which you alluded to earlier. How much of it was maybe a little bit better rate in there for a little bit better accident year priced margin than maybe you thought.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'll answer that. The answer is that it was better than anticipated loss trends, but loss trends unlike rate impact both accident year and prior period development. So there's no breakup of that. It was just, we had better loss trends. Now, a couple of factors. First, when we came into 2012, we were developing this guidance based on what were tougher third and fourth quarters of 2011. We were concerned that the benign loss trends of the prior five years had turned. While we didn't extrapolate those worse loss trends, we certainly adjusted and increased them over the first half of 2011. Now, what's turned out is that this year has looked a lot like the first half of 2011. The loss trends have been better than that. So I think -- that's been reflected in better -- in good development and in better accident year results. I don't know versus rate. I think the rates are -- they may be a little bit better than we thought we would get. Again, at the time, we weren't getting these type of rate increases, so it was hard to build in -- we were trying to achieve higher rate increases, but we didn't have them yet, so obviously you have to blend in the realistic with the desired. So but net-net, I just think loss trends have been the answer. In part that's -- maybe third and fourth quarter last year was an anomaly, in part it's due to things that are explainable like non-CAT related weather.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Heimermann,  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. - Analyst   [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 That's helpful. Then I guess it leads to another question. This is a little bit of a crystal ball question. But the theme of the last 10 years has been we've been -- maybe not 10, let's say 8, has been we've been surprised by how good loss trend has been. How much credibility do you put in a scenario where you're able to get rate the next couple years and you do that to reflect loss trend low rates but also maybe there's built into that an expectation that the development we've seen can't last. But how much credibility would you give to a scenario where perhaps we continue to be surprised by the loss trend side and the development and what it means for priced ROEs?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I don't think I can answer that. The loss trends are developed by the actuaries. They take into account historical experience, recent experience, but they're longer term in nature. I don't know. I hope you're right. I hope that scenario plays out. But we just use historical data and go from there. We're not willing to say that loss trends have gone from 4% to 2% or anything like that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Heimermann,  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. - Analyst   [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Just one quick one on Property. Is that probably the line you'd point to where you might expect to see some moderation in pricing now that it looks like some of the reinsurance cost push has been collected?

 Greg Locraft, Morgan Stanley.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg Locraft,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We've talked a lot about margins and I guess I'm looking at the consensus number and my model's pretty close to consensus. The only way we can get to the fourth quarter is -- did I think, by basically all bringing up our margin assumptions by 200 to 300 basis points. So my question is how sustainable are the current trends? Because obviously you feel good on that line item into the fourth quarter and the year-over-year improvement should probably just hold all through next year as well. Is that a reasonable assumption?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All I can say about the fourth quarter in terms of what you can read into it, is the fact that we're assuming a combined ratio of about 2 points higher than the third quarter but about in line with the first half of this year. I mean, that's where we are on an ex-CAT basis -- on an ex-CAT basis of course, then we have CATs about 1.5 better. That's the answer to one. I don't know, what was your other?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg Locraft,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'm more -- because again, where consensus is versus where you're guiding to it's all pointing to better margin as you just said, better than what we're expecting. So, what I'm wondering is how this plays into next year's numbers as well. I'm trying to think about the improvement. Because you've not got rate on top of rate. The loss trend is more benign. You seem a little more confident -- you seem very much more confident in some of the problem areas that you were highlighting a year ago. So, it just seems like the trend on core margins is going to be better.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg, I see where you're going. What we're seeing is that the loss trend -- that the margins in the third quarter were much better than were embedded in the analyst forecast. The margin, implicit -- margin's a loose term. Margin usually refers to accident year. We're predicting results in the fourth quarter that aren't quite as good as the third quarter, but are better than the first half. Are they sustainable? I think what I said before was we expect some margin expansion next year, but on the other hand we're starting from a very benign base in a variety of areas. Now, in some areas, we're hoping to improve our loss experience like some of the Professional Liability areas where -- the crime areas, for example, where we've had some problems. But we shall see.
 But then some other areas, our experience in personal and commercial has been so good especially in non-CAT related weather that one would think some reversion mean -- we would do there. Then finally, when you look at the results next year, rate doesn't impact favorable development. So that's a wild card and we don't know how much prior period development we'll have. So that's the context. You have some things working for you in terms of what we expect better rates, better earned premium. You have some things maybe working against you, some reversion to the mean and the loss trends even if it's slightly and then you have the uncertainty of prior period development and you have lower interest rates.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg Locraft,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. It's just trying to get to kind of what we were thinking versus what you guys are now -- again, it's the guidance that we're getting, it's a lot more bullish than what I think some of us at least were thinking. If I could just back up in your commentary, I think during the call -- and I want to make sure I got this correct, did you say that there's 350 basis points of non-CAT benefit in the quarter? Was that the correct number? I know we've been talking about this in the Q&amp;A. But I just want to kind of nail down that number. Was it 350 basis points to this particular quarter?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg, it's -- careful, it's 350 basis points versus last year, about 250 basis points for the average of the last five years, in the Homeowner's business. So on our total results, that obviously is closer to 100 basis points. So just to give you a feel. Again to your comment, Greg, that what we're guiding to in the fourth quarter is better than you're carrying, well, we have the advantage of knowing the third quarter results when we develop that guidance. If we hadn't given you any guidance and you'd seen our third quarter results you probably would have improved your expected combined ratios based on those results too.

 Right. Okay. Then, John, again, just so -- is it 150 basis points then, that's the figure. I totally -- I'm glad I clarified it. It's 350 for the Homeowner's line. It's 150 benefit this particular quarter for the overall corporation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.5? It's 2.5 over 12. That's -- is that worldwide, Dino?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dino Robusto,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Personal Lines &amp; Claims   [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 That's worldwide. So it's 2.50. It's probably 100 or 78 -- take Homeowner's and divide it, Homeowner's into total premium and then multiply that by the 350. That will give you an idea. Or versus last year, 250 versus normal maybe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg Locraft,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Really, what I'm doing is I'm going to add that back in, look at the year-over-year, it's going to show some margin improvement. I'm still going to end up with a lot of margin improvement next quarter and sort of then I have to decide what to do next year. Okay. I'll keep fiddling with it. But it looks like you guys have hit a pretty good inflection. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. Remember, that non-cat related weather is one good example that's easy to give. We had just very good favorable loss experience in all of our lines this year.

 Jay Cohen, Bank of America.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Cohen,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Just two questions. The first is, given that the Claims trends have been better than you had expected earlier in the year, in the third quarter was there any favorable development from the first half of the year that flowed into the 3Q?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, not that we -- we've said in the past, we don't really -- CATs aside, we don't really show -- we don't really break it up that way. I don't know. Nothing material as far as we can tell.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Cohen,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. Then secondly, given the very strong capital position going into next year and given that the fact that the stock has moved up on a price to book basis, you look at the dividend and it's been gradually moving up, relatively slowly. Would it make sense at this point to speed up that acceleration from a dividend standpoint?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Finnegan,  Chubb Corp - Chairman and CEO   [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Let me caveat before Ricky says anything. (laughter) That decision might depend upon where the taxes come out. Taxes in Washington come out and whether we're being taxed at 20% or 40%. Go ahead, Ricky.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ricky Spiro,  Chubb Corp - EVP and CFO   [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay, all I can tell you at this point obviously we'll relook at our dividend with our Board in the normal course. As you know, we've increased our dividend in each of the past 30 years. We'll take a number of factors into consideration including our capital position. As John said, the tax environment and hopefully, we've shown you over the years, we're committed to return our excess capital to our shareholders and dividends are an important part of that strategy. Having said that, I'm not going to make any comment about what our future dividend plans may or may not be.

 When we look at Claims specifically relating to medical care, is there any change in the trend there?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dino Robusto,  Chubb Corp - EVP, President - Personal Lines &amp; Claims   [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, not really. It's been pretty well stable and it clearly runs higher than the typical consumer price index and so we see it as the same.

 Brian Meredith,  UBS - Analyst   [90]

 Just a quick one here. Going back to the whole share repurchase, Ricky and John, do you ever think about share buyback with respect to kind of a payback period, because obviously if you're buying back your stock at 1.35%, at book value, 1.3%, it takes a while to earn that dilution book value per share back particularly given this low interest rate environment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ricky Spiro,  Chubb Corp - EVP and CFO   [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brian, it's Ricky. We look at it a bunch of different ways. We do look at payback. We do look at different return analyses. As John said early on, even at today's stock price and our current price to book value, valuation, we still see attractive economic opportunities in repurchasing our shares at our current price. So we do look at all those things. We do take them into consideration. But again, we still think that at today's price, it's still relatively attractive. Don't forget, with the low interest rate environment, you also don't have as many other opportunities to invest your money elsewhere and make better return.
