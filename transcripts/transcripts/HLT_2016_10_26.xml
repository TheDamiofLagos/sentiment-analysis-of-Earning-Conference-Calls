 Good morning and welcome to the Hilton Worldwide Holdings third-quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
 (Operator Instructions)
 Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Christian Charnaux, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you, Denise. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide third-quarter 2016 earnings call.
 Before we begin we would like to remind you that our discussion this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.

 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you, Christian, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Even with macro conditions that continue to underperform expectations, we delivered adjusted EBITDA and EPS consistent with our guidance, and continued to increase our global share of development activity in the quarter.
 Our objective is to drive value beyond what the broader economy gives us, and we believe our portfolio of clearly defined brands with global scale and distribution will continue to drive market share premiums, industry-leading net unit growth, and ultimately result in superior returns to our stockholders over time. We also have the opportunity to drive additional value by fully activating all segments of our business and achieving meaningful tax and capital market efficiencies through the spinoff of Park Hotels &amp; Resorts and Hilton Grand Vacations, both of which are on track for completion around year end.
 Moving specifically to the third-quarter results, our systemwide comparable RevPAR growth for the quarter was 1.3% on a currency neutral basis, driven entirely by rate, strong group business supported RevPAR growth in the quarter, but corporate transient was softer than expected, particularly in September. Calendar shifts had a negative impact in the quarter, as the unfavorable timing of July 4 more than offset the benefit of a favorable September holiday calendar.
 Quarterly results were also negatively impacted by continued weakness in oil and gas markets and by softer international performance, with political instability and terrorism in Turkey, Belgium, and France, strengthening currency in Japan, and VAT charges in China.
 As we look forward into Q4, we anticipate softness in transient growth to continue, especially given the unfavorable October calendar shift. Additionally, November and December are typically low group months, resulting in lower transient compression. Combined, we think this will result in flat to slightly positive systemwide RevPAR growth for the fourth quarter. As a result, we forecast full year 2016 systemwide RevPAR growth of 1.5% to 2%.
 As noted on our earlier calls, our prior guidance was based on 2016 US GDP growth expectations of 1.5% to 2.5%, while our current outlook incorporates a more tempered consensus view of 1.25% to 1.5% GDP growth, down plus or minus 50 basis points since July. Year to date, at a high level, when adjusting for calendar shifts and other one-time events, we actually see pretty consistent RevPAR performance across the three major buckets of demand. Roughly half of our mix is business transient which has been growing at approximately 1%, with the rest split pretty evenly between leisure transient and group business, both of which have been growing roughly 100 to 200 basis points above that.
 Looking forward, we continue to expect that the lodging cycle will align with the broader business cycle. In the US, our largest market, macro indicators point to a more positive outlook on the demand side as we head into next year, with forecasts for slightly accelerating GDP growth, growth of nonresidential fixed investment, rising corporate profits, incremental jobs growth, and certainly having the election cycle behind us won't hurt. Paired with easier comps, this suggests modest demand acceleration from current levels.
 The two pieces of business where we have reasonable sightlines, corporate negotiated and group, also support a potential acceleration in demand next year. We're in the early stage of negotiating corporate rates for next year, and given record US occupancy levels, we expect to increase rates roughly 3% to 4%. Similarly, in the first half of 2017, we're seeing mid-single digit systemwide group revenue position growth. This anticipated US demand growth will be paired with supply growth that is expected to increase around 30 basis points next year to slightly less than 2%, which is well below prior cycle peaks and still below long-term averages.
 There is good visibility in the new capacity given the years of lead time, and annual estimates of supply growth this cycle have pretty consistently been higher than what has actually been delivered. Overall development continues to be largely driven by economically rational projects in markets that can support room growth, and with brands that are the most desired by customers, particularly as lending standards have tightened in this lower growth market.
 Overall, we believe 2017 will be another year of positive RevPAR growth, in the 1% to 3% range, but would note that it is early and there's still a great deal of uncertainty on how well the economy will actually perform next year. The other key growth driver for our business is net unit growth, which adds more visibility than topline growth. Our pace of room signings continues to increase, and we expect another record year of more than 100,000 room signings.
 This fuels our pipeline, now at approximately 300,000 rooms representing a 15% year-over-year increase. Additionally, construction starts are 14% ahead of last year meaning half the pipeline, or nearly 150,000 rooms, are under construction and largely expected to open over the next three years. As a result, we expect to increase our net rooms additions to more than 50,000 rooms next year.
 We continue to lead the industry with 6% to 7% annualized organic net unit growth, with little or no capital commitment on our part. Our accelerating capital-light growth is driven by all of our high quality, clearly defined brands, with each of our brand segments at record pipelines. We continued to accelerate our growth by deploying existing brands to new markets and organically launching new brands.
 Regarding specific brands, we have some developments that I'm excited to share. In luxury, the Waldorf-Astoria Beverly Hills will begin accepting reservations this month for its opening next summer, and the Waldorf-Astoria San Francisco was recently added to our pipeline. We just celebrated the 750th hotel opening in our All Suites category, which includes our Embassy, Homewood and Home2 brands. As a reminder, Home2 is the third-largest brand under development in the United States, only five years after its launch.
 More recently, we've been further leveraging Home2's success by developing dual-branded products with Tru, our newest and fastest-growing brand. We now have more than 140 Tru hotels representing nearly 14,000 rooms in the pipeline, up an impressive 55% from the second quarter. Including all rooms in various stages of development, we have 360 hotels representing approximately 35,000 rooms. The brand continues to gain tremendous traction with developers, and we're looking forward to opening our first Tru early next year.
 Our industry-leading rate of net unit growth off a base of nearly 800,000 rooms continues to build our scale. We're in a business where scale matters, and we are leaning in on these scale advantages to innovate faster, improving both our guest experience and our owners' returns. Guests continue to prefer our web direct channels, with share increasing to 28% of distribution mix in the quarter, our highest level ever.
 Our guests have successfully completed 20 million digital check ins. The world's going mobile, and our top-rated hotel booking app in the Apple Store is the Hilton Honors app, which is downloaded on average every eight seconds. Through our app, guests can download their room key on their mobile device and head straight to their self-selected room upon arrival in nearly 600 hotels today. Over the next year, we expect to deploy this capability to every one of our hotels in 80 major North American markets, representing nearly half of our total global system.
 Earlier this week, we announced the sale of Blackstone shares, representing 25% of the Company, to HNA Group, a leader in the global travel and tourism industry, with market-leading positions in aviation, hospitality, and travel services. We believe this strategic sale at a premium price with a thoughtful shareholder agreement that includes a two-year lockup, a perpetual standstill and limited voting rights is a win for all parties. On the strategic side, there are many opportunities to leverage both Hilton and HNA's respective travel assets and capabilities.
 While we're in the early stages, we anticipate that connecting our hotel system to HNA's customers through their online and off-line travel agencies, and their extensive airline network and loyalty program could be of meaningful mutual benefit to both companies. We also believe that HNA's financial businesses and extensive relationship should afford opportunities to support our development growth both in and outside of China.
 Lastly, as we near the completion of our announced spinoffs of Park and HGV, we would like to provide you with further information on each of the Companies' strategies, and facilitate further interaction with the leadership of all three Companies. I'm happy to announce we plan to host and Investor Day on Thursday, December 8 at the Conrad New York, and we look forward to catching up with all of you more than.
 In closing, although our third quarter topline growth was weaker than expected, and macro uncertainty continues to weigh on sentiment, we are cautiously optimistic heading into 2017. We think our portfolio is uniquely positioned to further enhance value through sustainable, industry-leading unit growth, and full activation of our three businesses.
 With that, I'm now going to turn the call over to Kevin for a little bit more detail on the quarter. Kevin?

 Kevin Jacobs,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - EVP and CFO   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone.
 In the third quarter systemwide RevPAR growth was tempered by a variety of factors, most notably a softer than expected macro environment, with geopolitical uncertainty further weighing on growth. In addition, we estimate that one-time items such as calendar shifts and declines in oil and gas markets pressured topline performance by 100 to 150 basis points in the quarter, including approximately 70 basis points of net drag from the July 4 and Jewish holiday calendar shifts. Despite more modest topline gains, adjusted EBITDA of $765 million and adjusted EPS of $0.23 per share were in line with expectations, supported by good cost control and solid performance in our purchasing business.
 As Chris discussed, transient business was below expectations in the quarter, with RevPAR up 40 basis points. Business transient continued to be largely weak across industries and geographies with particular weakness in oil and gas markets. Leisure transient continues to be stronger than business transient on a relative basis, but was affected by terrorism and political instability in international markets.
 Group business increased approximately 4% in the quarter, with America's owned and operated group revenue up nearly 8% versus prior year on strong ADR gains and more than 100 basis points of room night growth. Convention and association business was particularly strong. Solid group trends also drove strong growth in America's owned and operated FNB revenue, which increased nearly 7% versus prior year, mostly as a result of 11% growth in banquets revenue.
 Turning to our segments in the quarter, management franchise fees grew more than 7% year over year to $470 million, in line with our expectations. Franchise fees increased over 8%, boosted by new hotel ramps, stronger-than-expected license fees, and solid new deal volume as Tru signings continue to outpace our expectations. Base management fees were flat versus the prior year due to softness in Japan, while one-time items helped incentive management fees, which were up nearly 9%.
 In our ownership segment, flat RevPAR growth and a 4% reduction in rooms largely driven by three lease removals contributed to a decline in adjusted EBITDA to $264 million in the quarter. RevPAR performance was primarily driven by weakness in the New York and Chicago markets, as supply growth and the convention calendar affected performance. Results were further pressured by softness in Japan; however, strength in our Hawaii properties help to mitigate some of these overhangs.
 Timeshare adjusted EBITDA was $85 million in the quarter. Overall timeshare sales volume increased 15% as a result of increased tour flow and net volume per guest of 5% and 9% respectively. Third-party developed intervals accounted for 63% of intervals sold in the quarter, up from 61% in the second quarter. At our current sales pace we have nearly six years of inventory, or 127,000 intervals, more than 80% of which are third-party developed.
 Turning to regional performance and outlook, in the US, comparable RevPAR grew 1.5% in the quarter. Performance was supported by good group business, with Orlando and Hawaii being the primary beneficiaries. Solid leisure demand during the summer months also contributed to positive growth. Results were affected by broader weakness in corporate transient business and oil and gas markets, which we expect to pressure fourth-quarter performance as well. To date, October trends are softer than anticipated and include an additional drag from the impact of hurricane Matthew.
 For full year 2016 we forecast US RevPAR growth in the low single digits. In the Americas outside the US, RevPAR rose a strong 6% versus the prior year, surpassing expectations. RevPAR in Canada increased by approximately 9%, driven by good group demand.
 Growth in the Caribbean was tempered by Zika current concerns, and Brazil continued to struggle given economic weakness, offsetting any Olympic-related demand gains. For full year 2016 we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be in the low to mid single-digit range.
 RevPAR in Europe decreased 70 basis points in the quarter due to weaker performance in continental Europe, partially offset by a 2% RevPAR gain in the UK and Ireland. Turkey suffered a 40% year-over-year decrease in the quarter due to terrorist attacks and political instability, which depressed inbound travel during the country's peak summer season. Terror attacks also weighed on France and Belgium, leading to declines in transient performance.
 While it's still too early to know the implications of Brexit, we expect increased uncertainty surrounding potential outcomes to temper regional performance. For full year 2016 we expect slightly positive RevPAR growth for the European region.
 RevPAR in the Middle East and Africa dropped 2.6% in the quarter, driven by unfavorable timing of Ramadan and the Haj, coupled with political unrest in certain African markets. Improved leisure performance in Egypt and an extension of the royal protocol in Saudi Arabia mitigated these shortfalls. Our full year 2016 RevPAR growth forecast for the region is slightly negative.
 In the Asia-Pacific region RevPAR increased 60 basis points largely due to slowing performance in Japan, as the stronger yen continued to reduce leisure demand, and slowing exports continue to weigh on the country's economic growth. Results were further pressured by the typhoon in September. RevPAR growth in China increased nearly 3% during the quarter. China growth was tempered however by the recent introduction of a nationwide VAT tax. We expect RevPAR growth in the Asia-Pacific region to increase in the mid-single digits for the full year, with RevPAR in China relatively stronger in a similar range.
 Both during and subsequent to the third quarter we successfully completed a number of capital markets transactions, all with the goal of better positioning Hilton, Park and HGV ahead of the spins around year end. Through these deals we reduced interest rates, pushed out and staggered our maturities, and secured greater financial flexibility for each Company. There is more detail on these transactions in our recently filed updated form 10s, and we intend to provide further detail on the capital structures of all three Companies at our Investor Day in December.
 During the quarter we also paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share bringing year-to-date cash dividends to $207 million. Our Board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2016. As Chris mentioned, given continued softness in the broader macro environment we are lowering our full year 2016 RevPAR growth guidance to 1.5% to 2%, and reducing our full year adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance ranges to reflect softer expected topline performance. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of $2.96 billion to $2.99 billion, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.86 to $0.89 per share.
 As with prior guidance please note that our full-year ranges do not incorporate the impact of our intended real estate and timeshare spins. For the fourth quarter of 2016 we expect systemwide RevPAR growth to be flat to modestly up, we expect adjusted EBITDA between $736 million and $776 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.20 to $0.23. Further details on our third-quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we published earlier this morning.
 This completes our prepared remarks we would now like to open the line for any questions you may have.

 Robin Farley, UBS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Arpine Kocharyan,  UBS - Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you. This is actually Arpine for Robin. Thank you for the detail on 2017 RevPAR in the prepared remarks but, could you just elaborate a little bit more in terms of factors you're looking at today? Specifically, what North American RevPAR is the current guidance for 2017 pricing and then in terms of group pace for 2017 overall, not just the first half of the year, what are you looking at today versus same time last year?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. Happy to do that. Thanks for the question. I know that's pretty much what is on everybody's mind is, what does the go-forward set up look like and I would say, as we said in the prepared comments, we've given you a sense of what we think. We're in the final stages of going through our budgets which are a granular buildup of every asset, every property around the world, aggregated together, to come to a result, and best we can give you guidance today, we come out at the -- in the 1% to 3% range.
 I think that the underpinning of that I covered a bit in my comments. I think the largest contributor to that is what we suggested, which is a belief based on what we see as a consensus view, that the broader economy, particularly here in the US, but I think on a global basis, is projected to pick up just a bit. And if you look at what's been weakest, it's been really the business transient side of the business as I said, when you clear out all the noise sort of growing it plus or minus 1%, we believe that if you have a little bit of an uptick in the broader economic environment, you have a little bit more certainty within -- particularly within the US with an election behind us, which we think has the potential to release some decision-making out of corporate America on investment and the like -- that you could as a consequence see a bit of an uptick in that part of the business, which is our largest segment and which has been performing at the lowest levels of all of our segments.
 In terms of the sightlines we talked about, I want to be cautious in the sense that it's early. We're not even done with this year, let alone into next, we're pre-election and what we're trying to do, as I said, is judge based off of what consensus estimates are. What sightlines we do have certainly support that, as I said we've gone through a very granular budget process, aggregating every property in the world, which gives us a decent sense of around the world, what our teams think and that forms the basis of this.
 We look at where we are in our negotiations with all of our corporate customers, which I noted, which supports this up in the 3% to 4% range. And as we look at the group position going into next year, as I said, the first half of the year is quite strong. It's actually a little higher than -- I said mid-single digits -- it's really 6% or 7%, a little bit higher than pure mid-single digits. And if you look at it for the full year, it's probably in the low single -- lower single digits, but there's a lot of time left to fill in, in the second half of the year, that would be typically what would happen.
 We'll go into the year, probably as we finish this year, with about 70% of our group bookings on the books, but we are obviously busily working towards increasing the group booking position in the final stages of this year. So I think all of those things are generally positive indicators, but I would, again, bring you back to the core underpinning, which is a view on the broader economy and our view on the broader economy as being really informed by consensus views of folks that are studying this.
 I think, to the extent that those views end up being correct, I feel pretty darn good about being able to deliver in the range that we talked about. If those consensus views are wrong, obviously, either on the high or the low, it would have an impact on our ability to deliver the 1% to 3%.

 Harry Curtis, Nomura.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Harry Curtis,  Nomura Securities Intl - Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning, everyone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Harry Curtis,  Nomura Securities Intl - Analyst   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I just had a quick follow-up on your answer there before I get to my question. Chris, as you talk to other CEOs, what is their body language for kind of loosening up the travel purse strings and what do they need to see?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I would say, again, anecdotal, obviously. I talk to a lot of other CEOs. I talk to a lot of our biggest customers. I would say that there is a view right now, particularly exacerbated by the US election cycle, that everybody's nervous. They don't know -- there's just a great deal of broad uncertainty.
 And when I talked to CEOs, I think, my sense from them is that not just loosening the purse strings a little bit on travel, but just broadly making decisions, whether that be more hiring, more investment in technology, plant, equipment, all of the things that make up nonresidential fixed investment, which still has the highest correlation to demand growth in our business that we can track, I think broadly as I talk to them, I think people when they have a little bit -- companies and CEOs -- when they have a little more certainty, I think, do want to start to make decisions again to start investing and hiring and traveling and doing all the things they need to do to drive the growth in their business.
 I think the -- this cycle of election -- I don't -- I mean, everybody's watching it as I am, I think it's been an unusual cycle and as a consequence I think it has slowed down the economy probably more dramatically than I've seen certainly in my adult life, just in the sense of creating such an aura of uncertainty that people are sort of waiting to make decisions until it's over. Now, we don't know what's going to happen, but the one thing we do know is it'll be over on November 8 by the time we close out at midnight. We're going to have certainty of who our next President is going to be, and I think just the fact of having that type of certainty is going to be beneficial.
 So, sort of a rambling answer but I think you are going to get a lot of things that are going to sort of get freed up a bit, which is I think one of the core underpinnings for why you might see broader economic growth pick up a bit. I don't think that means in my opinion or anything I'm reading from a consensus point of you says the economy is going to start roaring. I don't think that's the view. I think it's just that things have been pretty locked up, and that they're going to start to unlock a little bit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Harry Curtis,  Nomura Securities Intl - Analyst   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So my real question, not that the other one was not real -- is --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your second question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Harry Curtis,  Nomura Securities Intl - Analyst   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 But my real first question is, your relationship with HNA as you envision it over the next several years. What I'm trying to get a better understanding of is, how you expect joint ventures to proceed and impact in China on EBITDA growth as a result of this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, I think it's really early to start to translate it into impact on EBITDA growth, so I'm going to avoid answering that simply because I can't give you a rational answer yet because it's relatively early days. Having said that, we've spent, as you would imagine, a great deal of time with the leadership of HNA as a lead up to this transaction, and I think we believe and our Board believe that there were some serious compelling strategic reasons why this was beneficial to our Company.
 You can imagine some of those, and as time goes on will give you more details as we can, but they are big time in the travel and tourism business. They are big tour operators. They have a big off-line travel agency business, they are the second biggest online travel agency business, one of the biggest airlines in China and the world. They are transporting through their aviation system, hundreds of millions of people a year, they have tens of millions of loyalty members.
 Now, obviously, incredibly well respected in China and now as a global Fortune 500 company around the world, so the idea is quite simple in a sense is that we have a big customer base. They have a big customer base. China is both of the fastest-growing lodging market in the world, it's also the largest outbound market in the world and one of the fastest-growing outbound markets in the world. While obviously there is some overlap in our current businesses, there's not much overlap between our core customer base and theirs, thus a tremendous opportunity to be able to connect those customer bases in ways that I think is going to help feed our system throughout the world and particularly in China, but it's also going to help feed their system.
 So I think there's a mutually beneficial ways to look at this. We are having those discussions sort of putting, as I would say, the meat on the bones of exactly how that's going to work. But you can imagine taking our hundreds of millions of folks and their hundreds of millions of folks where there's not a lot of overlap and connecting the dots can be incredibly powerful.
 And in terms of the development growth in China, they have a tremendous network of financial services investments and relationships in that market that we think are going to be hugely beneficial to us and our growth over time. Recognizing that all of our growth in terms of our new unit growth is really dependent upon third-party capital in China and everywhere else, and the more access we have and relationships that we can build in all parts of the world but particularly the fastest-growing market in the world in China, we think it can be a tremendously beneficial to us over time.
 So we are very excited about that HNA deal in every way. Obviously it helps with our overhang issue, and we think we were quite thoughtful about how we protected all of our existing shareholders against all the things that you would want us to protect against. But at the same time manage to take down the overhang of Blackstone, which we certainly hear a lot about in the marketplace.
 The strategic elements of this over time I think are going to be even more powerful because while the overhang is important obviously, that would eventually fix itself. I think this is quite an elegant way to help fix a lot of it but long-term, I think the relationship, the fact that they're going to have a $6.5 billion investment in us, and our success, and given their relationships globally and in China, I think is going to be incredibly powerful for us.
 So we'll -- I can't translate that to EBITDA growth rate yet. Okay? Give us a little bit of time and as we pull together the elements of this partnership, you're obviously going to hear a lot more about it because it we're obviously going to want you to.

 Good morning, Jeff.

 Joseph Greff,  JPMorgan - Analyst   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Can you guys talk about how you're thinking about the composition of 2017 net unit growth and how that compares to what you've done so far in 2016? And then, with the gross additions to the pipeline, are you anticipating that those take longer to open just given the economic backdrop we are living in right now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [18]

 Yes. I would say composition-wise, very similar, 2017 very similar to 2016. It will be higher but if you look at the proportions of it, where it's going to be and what segments it's going to be in, I'd say it is similar.
 In terms of the pipeline, in terms of whether the pipeline is what we're signing is getting extended out, hard to say. I mean, my instinct, Joe, is if you look at what we're signing this year, by the time the year's out, not an insignificant component of that is going to be Tru. We're going to end up probably by the time the year is out signing 20,000 to 25,000 rooms for Tru? I mean, just given what's in production, and those are much more readily financeable given the dollar amounts we're talking about, and people seem to be very able to get access to financing levels to get this done. They are also a shorter gestation a period given their smaller properties and they take less time to build.
 So I would say I'm not seeing any, incrementally over the last quarter or two I'm not seeing anything that says -- that if I were to try and the semi-scientifically in my head, as I'm thinking about it, take what we're adding to the pipeline and what's being delivered -- are we extending it? I would say ultimately it's pretty comparable. It's offsetting given that Tru is a shorter gestation period and smaller pieces.

 Hey, everybody. Good morning.

 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Carlo Santarelli,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Two-part question, both focused on, Chris, some of your comments from earlier. You mentioned the group pace for next year, I thought you said kind of first-half 2017 group pace. Do you have any early indications on second half?
 And then also, as it pertains to the corporate negotiated rates trending up 3% to 4%, are there any types of guarantees in terms of volume or anything that are being kind of -- that have changed materially I would say in those corporate rate negotiations?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All right. So yes. On the group side I think I gave the number I intended to. For the first half of the year it's up, call it 5% to 7%. For the full year it's up probably 2% to 3%, something like that, so that obviously implies the second half of the year is lighter. Part of that's just sort of the convention cycle, part of that is second half of the year is a long way away. So -- but that's the full-year look on it.
 On the volume question, on transient, the short answer is no, we don't really have a lot of guarantees of volume. There are incentives built in to pricing so that, they are not guarantees as much as, you get a better price if your volume is higher or you get a worse price if it's lower. But it's not -- it doesn't -- the set up is not in the form of a guarantee.
 Anecdotally, again, it goes back to the question, I think, Harry asked, about what are you hearing from CEOs? What are you hearing from customers, CEOs of companies that are good customers of ours?
 I'm not hearing anybody really say that, hey, we're going to be cutting back on a lot of volume. I mean, they're obviously pushing back on our trying to push rates up. That's why we're at 3% to 4%, but they know occupancy levels are high so they are accepting of that. I think if I had to summarize my discussions anecdotally I'd say it feels like flat -- it feels like sort of flat volume.
 I think if the economy gets worse, I think it'll drive volumes lower but I think as the economy gets a little bit better it will keep it flat or maybe you'll see a little bit more. The highest correlation to demand in the hotel business is nonresidential fixed investment. I've been studying this for 15 years, and it's ebbed and flowed in terms of what the R-squared is, but it's always been very high.
 If you look at what's been happening this year, as we've seen business transient growth levels really drop precipitously. I mean, we were in the 6% to 8% range. Now we're in the 1% range, and you look at what's happened with nonresidential fixed investment.
 Nonresidential fixed investment is going backwards, it's negative growth this year. I think everybody's broader expectations are that's going to increase next year. If nonresidential fixed investment increases next year, I think you will see flat or increasing volumes in business transient. So I think we should all watch that in the broader economy carefully because we're going to track, generally on the topline we're going to track in line with that business transient, very much so.

 Great. Thank you, and then Kevin you might have said this in your remarks and I apologize if I missed it, but I assume some of the timeshare margin softness was related to timing, but is there anything else you can kind of add to the decline year over year in segment margin?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Kevin Jacobs,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - EVP and CFO   [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, you've got it Carlo. We left the overall guidance range the same for timeshare, there's about $5 million or $6 million of timing items that are related to -- or $5 million or $6 million that are related to exactly what you say, which is timing items, so nothing really going on there.

 Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Can you just remind us of what your capital allocation priorities will be post the spin as you balance some of the added financial flexibility from the recent transactions with the softening macro?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. I think from a capital allocation point of view we are exactly where we've been. We want to get the balance sheet to a credit profile that is low-grade investment-grade. We think that's in the low 3s. We're sort of there now. We leveraged up a teeny amount related to all the spins and the costs and the incremental G&amp;A that's associated with the spins, but we very quickly get it back down.
 We're going to continue to pay a modest a dividend. We're not really thinking of doing anything material to the dividend, and then using the incremental cash flow to buy back stock. The likelihood is, we'll be discussing with our Board that early next year, we will be able to be in a position to begin a buyback program. That's pretty much what we've been saying, nothing's really changed in that regard.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen Grambling,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Great. And then you mentioned earlier about the potential for renegotiating your corporate credit card program. Can you just talk about the various financial impacts from that? Or how that could impact the business? And maybe sizing, what it would look like right now? Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I would love to but I can't right now. We're literally in the middle of a bidding process amongst a number of bidders, and I would prefer to get to the end of that process and not debate it or negotiate it publicly. So give us a little bit more time. We're not -- we're getting close to the final stages of that. And when we have that done, we'll obviously be happy to talk about it and give you a sense of where it ends up.
 We have a lot -- we have very healthy competition and we think we're going to get a very positive outcome for the Company. I'd rather leave it at that until we're done.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen Grambling,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Fair enough. So if I can maybe sneak one other quick one in, just on the direct booking efforts, can you just update us on what the net impact has been as the penetration has grown? Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. Our direct booking efforts, you can see from some of the stats we gave in the prepared comments, is working well. The whole objective here has been, where we can have a direct relationship with a customer we want to, because we think in the end customers get the best value and will have the best experience.
 We want them to know that, and to the extent that they get the best experience and we can do it through our lowest-cost distribution channels, it's better for us, it's better for customers, and it's better for owners. Which is who -- we're here to serve all constituencies, and you can see from the stats that it's working really well.
 We've had over 200 basis points of channel shift to our direct channels. We've had huge increases in our Honors enrollment, up 60% year to date, and when you look at our net rate structures, everything that we see across all of our rate structures suggests that our owners and we are benefiting from it.
 Having said that, it's really important to know that we still have a healthy relationship with the OTAs, we're still doing a lot of work with them. There are still customers that for whatever reasons don't want to have a direct relationship with us, and that we still want to have stay with us and that we can access through intermediaries including the OTAs. And for those customers that understand this set up and still do not want to have a direct relationship, we obviously want to serve them as well. So we've had a relationship over the long term with the OTAs, we will continue to have that relationship where they have unique access to a customer we may not be able to have access to.
 The combination of those things I think can be quite powerful for us, but we think customers are increasingly understanding the benefits of a book direct relationship, as is depicted with the channel shift we have.

 Shaun Kelley,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a little bit more granular of a question but, Kevin, in the guidance, I think the fourth quarter is looking for 2% to 4% management and franchise fee growth, and if we think about sort of your algorithm with 6% to 7% net unit growth and still positive RevPAR, even if modest, it seems like a little bit of a wider spread in the fourth quarter. So is there anything one-time in that or anything that might be driving that spread? And then my follow-up will go ahead and be, how do you think about that spread next year when we have to think about FX and mix from new openings?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Kevin Jacobs,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - EVP and CFO   [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. So the first part, Sean, is easy, we did a couple of a pretty significant one-time items, primarily termination fees that affected the growth rate this year. So the algorithm, if you will, is pretty much intact when you look at the full year. I think we think about the algorithm going forward in the fee segment as being just about the same as you described, if you look at sort of same-store sales growth plus net unit growth that ought to be the algorithm in the fee section other than, as you mentioned FX, it's hard to predict. We don't bake FX into our algorithms, it's really hard to.
 So I don't know if you want to add anything to that Chris.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No. On December 8 when we get together and lay out all three companies separately, we'll lay out in great detail sort of the -- how we view the algorithm going forward for Hilton Worldwide, for main Co.

 Felicia Hendrix,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, I want to go back to the HNA announcement because we've gotten a lot of questions from investors regarding the transaction, so I just wanted to touch on a few of them. The first is just regarding the incremental sale of the 54 million shares of stock by Blackstone following the sale HNA prior to the REIT election. So we've gotten a lot of questions about how the math works, and the ownership restrictions under the REIT tax laws, so maybe you can walk us through that, I think it would be helpful.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I'd be happy to but we don't -- time does not allow for it. Kidding aside, the rules that we're dealing with within the IRS code are called the EIK rules. They are incredibly complex, and very difficult to come up with an easy equation for you of, they own X, they're selling Y, because it has a lot to do with how Blackstone owns the shares in the Company in the various funds that they have. Very complex attribution rules, and even attribution on a go-forward basis has between large shareholders like HNA and Blackstone, even though they are unrelated in the attribution rules, they become related to a certain degree.
 I'm not trying to be evasive. The truth is there a lot of really smart people on our tax, and with outside advisors that have figured out how all this works, because ultimately we have to get an opinion that says that we meet the REIT qualification rules. As we've done all of that work, again, not a simple equation because of the complexities of the attribution rules, it became apparent to us in doing the work that in order to qualify we needed to have Blackstone sell down 5.5%, and that's why we've disclosed it.
 Obviously, they have until -- we can do the spins without that selldown, because this problem only arises as a consequence of the HNA deal, so really they have to have done this by the time the HNA deal closes, so we could do the spins and there was no EIK issue under the set up pre-HNA. Now that the HNA deal is getting done, prior to that closing, in order to meet the REIT qualification test they would have to sell down the 5.5%.
 So I know you want me to sit and give you a very simple equation. It's just not that simple, but we are 100% confident that the work that has been done is right, and that if they sell down 5.5% prior to HNA closing, we will meet all the REIT qualification rules up front and be able to continue to meet those rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Felicia Hendrix,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. So just to paraphrase, you need to be below 35% and you can't just take the 25% HNA plus the then 15%-ish --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No -- it would take literally 50 pages of analysis to do this and I don't have it in my head. It is much more complex than that, and there's no way anybody -- I'm not being -- there's no way anybody can do it, because you'd have to know the intricacies of how Blackstone holds all this and how HNA is going to hold all this. Because the attribution rules are not entirely logical.
 It is not a simple equation and, again, I'm not trying to be evasive. It is not that simple. The thing I think that's important for investors to know is that this fixes it. Okay? And that the timing of it is such that it needs to be done before the closing of HNA buying 25% of the company, and there will be no issue. It will be solved permanently.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Felicia Hendrix,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. But the 5.5%, the 54 million shares, that's all they need to sell.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 That's it. That's all they need to sell. Now, Blackstone can sell whatever -- it's their choice whether they want to sell more, but the contractual commitment that we have with them is that they will do this, so that we make sure that Park qualifies as a REIT.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Felicia Hendrix,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And then, this gets to my next question. So I was just wondering if you can address any risks to the HNA transaction, particularly on the regulatory side, and what steps need to be taken for it to get approved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No. I mean, there is not much to say about that. Obviously we just announced the deal. We do not think that they are big regulatory challenges to get over. And so I do not personally think that there's a great deal of risk from a regulatory point of view. But we'll go through -- time will tell, we will go through the process.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Felicia Hendrix,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. And then you addressed this -- this is my final question -- talking about the relationship with HNA and all the kind of the synergistic relationship that you can have. But we do -- we get questions about the two Board seats that are going to HNA, and if you foresee any concerns or if you have any concerns about conflict of interest there?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No, I don't. I think if you -- we attached the shareholder agreement and filed it so that if you want to, or any investor wants to, you can read -- I think we filed 180 pages of supporting documentation, so everything is 100% transparent. I think if you looked at how we dealt with -- how they come on the Board with one HNA affiliated member, one unaffiliated independent member. Both Board members that have to go through a vetting process with our nominating committee where we are able to say yes or no, and how those Board members can interact or participate on issues that might be in conflict with HNA's investment.
 Or, in the event that there is other M&amp;A activity that we're interested in pursuing, if you look at it very carefully, we were very thoughtful about making sure that where there might be potential for conflict, we limited their voting rights. We limited what they can participate on in Board discussions and on the Board. We also limited their voting rights, ultimately, on certain transactions and events to make sure that we dealt with those conflicts.
 We spent months, literally, of time, on these issues. We had a special committee of our Board that went through an incredibly rigorous process with outside advisors, both on the banking, legal side, management was very actively engaged with them, in giving our advice. The reason it took a couple months is because we wanted to make sure we were protecting the base of other shareholders in the Company against any potential conflict so again, you can read it in detail.
 I feel incredibly comfortable that we have protected against any eventuality and that we're going to be able to run the Company the way we need to run the Company, that they're going to be engaged with us in a very constructive way, and that anywhere there is a potential for conflict, vis-a-vis existing shareholders, we protected the existing shareholders including ourselves against any of those concerns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [55]

 It is, I would say largely rate. It's a little bit of volume. But I'd say best I can remember it's like 80/20, 80% rate, 20% volume but there is a little bit more volume.

 Good morning, guys. Can I get a clarification, first. You talked about the Tru brand and its contribution to the pipeline. How many franchised units are actually under construction today, or by the end of this year do you anticipate?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I think by the end of this year, probably a dozen, something like that. I can get a -- maybe a little bit higher. But I'd say 10 to 20.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bill Crow,  Raymond James - Analyst   [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I assume that's in line with your expectations you had.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. Everything, given we just launched in February, yes. Everything, some deal signings, pipeline, under construction, are all ahead of our expectations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bill Crow,  Raymond James - Analyst   [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All right. If you don't mind, I want to ask a big picture question on timeshare for those of us that don't spend as much time looking at that industry. Chris, who's the next buyer of timeshare? I mean it doesn't seem to me like millennials are -- have the loyalty or maybe the interest of doing it. The baby boomers are getting towards 70 years old, they are not necessarily -- so who is the next generation of buyers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You know what, Bill? It's a great question. I think we're all the next generation of buyers, right? So if you look at the breakdown in where timeshare, where we are selling timeshare, it's a pretty diverse set -- a pretty diverse demographic, and you got to remember that what timeshare is selling is a vacation. It's not -- this is not a second home or a third home market. This is simply selling -- if you're going to go on vacation once a year, you can do it and save a lot of money and have a lot more space and take your whole family and you can trade it for wherever you want to be or you can trade it for hotel rooms.
 It's an incredibly flexible vacation alternative. I think when you -- if you went through the sales pitch, what you'd find is that's what's compelling. People look at it, and those people who have one or two in many cases, three or four units, are basically saying, yes, I'm going to take one or two or three weeks of vacation, and this is a very cost efficient way for me to take vacation, be able to take my family or friends, have a kitchen, have a washer, dryer and have all these things.
 You've got to sort of break -- and I know you know this -- I think you have to break from -- the people that don't understand the business very well I think of it more as, this is sort of in lieu of a second home or whatever, and it is just not that. So I think it's appealing to anybody that is looking to go on a vacation, and is looking for a value proposition and I think that transcends age, honestly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bill Crow,  Raymond James - Analyst   [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All right. Maybe we'll get more into it at your meeting up in December.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Yes. We'll have our whole timeshare team there with us as well.

 Thomas Allen,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning. So it's been about a month since Marriott closed on the Starwood deal, now that you've gotten some kind of real-time data, any updated thoughts on the potential impact to your business? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No. I'm not going to -- I mean, the way I think about it is we are very confident in the strategy that we're pursuing and that we've articulated which is, we're very focused on having purebred brands that are leaders in their individual segments, that have clearly defined swim lanes, that have premium market share, and as a consequence, help us drive industry-leading organic unit growth. That's our strategy.
 Others have taken different paths. I'm not going to get into -- obviously we've chosen our strategy because we think it's the best strategy. Otherwise we would change it.
 I remain confident in our strategy. I think as we continue to deliver the results that we are delivering in net unit growth, particularly in the post-spin world, I think the strategy and the success of it will speak for itself.
 As for what Marriott or anybody else is doing, I'm not going to comment on it. I think you've got to ask them if you want to talk about their strategy. I'm sure they're going to have a call in the next couple of weeks and you can ask them about it. We're very confident in our strategy. You can see in terms of deal signings, starts, net unit growth, all those things that are incredibly positively impactful to our bottom line, and our story, we're continuing to pick up some pretty good momentum.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thomas Allen,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. I guess my question was more, are you seeing it impact your unit growth? Or is it helping you negotiate with OTAs, but I think the second part of your question largely answered that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We are doing just fine. We are picking up. Lots of reasons for why we're gaining momentum, but I think the statistics sort of speak for themselves. We continue to pick up some steam.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thomas Allen,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. And then just my follow-up, in terms of direct booking push, how are you thinking about it? Is it impacting RevPAR at all?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I can't -- it is not affecting RevPAR in a material way. It's really hard to sort of -- I know others have said that it is so many basis points. I mean, as we've studied it, I think it's really hard to say.
 I think intellectually, it's hard to debate that it's not having a little bit of impact, given de-ranking and dimming that's going on within the OTA world. But it's not so meaningful that we can really measure it in a hard way.
 What I would say is, if we look at it, and we have measured it very carefully, we look at our net rate effectively, the net rate, net of distribution costs, relative of where we are now versus where we were, we're better off across the board. Meaning that, you'd be willing to sacrifice in theory a little topline growth if the result was, you are bringing your distribution cost down and that your net rate effectively is higher. Across every one of our categories our net rates are higher.
 So there's probably some modest amount of impact built in to the last couple quarters and the next couple of quarters of RevPAR growth. On the headline RevPAR, but on the net rate basis, on a net rate basis, we're better off because we're shifting to our lowest-cost channels, and ultimately our job is to drive better results for our owners who are investing all the capital to help us continue to drive that net unit growth we're talking about. Our owners are incredibly supportive of what we're doing because they're benefiting from what's going on.

 Wes Golladay,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning, everyone. Going back to the scale question, how big -- how much runway do you have to capture scale? Do you need to get X percent of a market or a certain size globally? Where do you get the most bang for the buck on getting scale?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Here is the thing. I think scale does matter. I said it in my prepared comments. And I think we have it, right?
 I guess we went from the largest in the world to the second largest, post the Marriott Starwood merger but if you take our pipeline and our rooms in existing supply, we have 1.1 million rooms. We think that gives us all the scale that we need and we certainly, if you look at the market share numbers that we're driving in each of our brands, that's partly -- obviously great products, great service -- but partly the result of the network effect that scale creates. If you look at each of those brands, they are leading their segments in terms of market share so I think, as scientific evidence would say, scale matters and we have it, and what we are obviously trying to do is then lead into it more around the world and build more network effect in the various regions around the world where we operate.
 So we feel really good about where -- there is no deficiency, I guess I'd say. I think there's opportunity. We've got enough of the network effect that I think shows up in all the numbers that I just described to be able to really take advantage of the scale, and now it is to opportunistically continue to layer brands in different locations and different chain scales in markets to just continue to strengthen that network effect.

 Okay. And then looking at your various regions and the set up for next year, how do you see -- do you see any demand headwinds in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, or is the supply going to be a concern in any of those regions? And looking specifically at a smaller market for you, the Middle East, Africa, for the year-to-date numbers, occupancy is down quite a bit but you seem to have the most pricing power in that region, so just kind of curious what's going on there.

 On a regional basis, I think, honestly next year is going to look a lot like this year. I hope it's all a step change up a little bit, but in terms of the relative performance around the world, I think it's going to look a lot like this year, which is Asia-Pacific probably leading the charge, non-US Americas, sort of doing reasonably well and comparable. The US market being sort of in the middle of the pack, and Europe and Middle East, Africa, being a little bit lower than the midpoint because of an assumption that Europe -- European economy is going to continue to have anemic growth and Brexit generally, as you get closer to an actual event of the UK leaving the EU.
 In terms of thea Middle East, I think it's a very small region relative to many of the others. There's just enough sort of disruption and enough places where I think we do expect to be positive next year, but relatively modest growth there.

 Smedes Rose,  Citigroup - Analyst   [82]

 Hi. Thanks. Just along those same lines, as you think about next year and across the 1% to 3% outlook, could you maybe comment on how you think the owned portfolio would do? Do you think maybe like 100 basis points short of that range, given the concentration in some large US markets that face some tough difficulties. How are you sort of thinking about that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes. I mean, again, we'll give you a lot more detail on that when we have all the Park folks and we've completed the, fully completed the budget process, which is nearing completion but not done. But I think your summary is probably a reasonable assumption.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Smedes Rose,  Citigroup - Analyst   [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay. And I just wanted to ask you one more question on your performance systemwide in the third quarter for RevPAR. I know it's not one for one with the STR, but it seems like no matter how you cut it looking at your brands, looking at your US only, it was a significant shortfall to what STR put up, which would have experienced the same calendar shift you talked about. So do you attribute that to -- you talked about some of the regional weakness in more oil markets, or is there concentration in areas that were relative underperformers? I just would like to understand that a little better, because it just seems -- such a shortfall.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chris Nassetta,  Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. - President and CEO   [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Smedes, it's a good question. I'd say there are three or four reasons for it as we've looked at it, some of which we've talked about before. The STR data first of all is non-comp, where we are comp so you have to adjust for that. Segment weighting, which you talked about, obviously going to have an impact.
 I think a few other things, one, we're more urban in orientation than you would find on average in STR, and the urban markets, particularly because business transient was so weak, were more beat up. We have a little bit higher average representation from the oil and gas markets, which were -- it's hard to believe they keep getting worse but they do, which I think hurt us.
 And then there's probably, to my earlier comment, a little bit impact from the OTA situation that I talked about. Again, we're willing to trade a little bit of headline, topline RevPAR for net RevPAR, if you will, that is higher because that drives a better result for our owners. But my guess is, again, I can't measure it perfectly, my guess is there's certainly some modest impact in the third quarter from what's going on with the OTAs.

 Well, thanks, everybody, for the time today. I'm glad to see this call worked out better than the last one when the AT&amp;T trunk line shut down on us. We got to do in one shot instead of two.
 We appreciate the time, really look forward to getting together with as many as can join us in New York on December 8 at the Conrad in New York downtown. We'll have all the management teams there, and I look forward to walking you through all three companies in a great deal of detail. So we'll see you then, and thanks again for the time today.
